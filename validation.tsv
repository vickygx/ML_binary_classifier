-1	Additional information that should've been added to the acid rain experiment is that there needed to be more samples becaus somthing could've went wrong during at least one of the trials. Bin they didnt just try a plain trial with other things to see if it effected the ending mass.
1	In order to figure out how to replicate this I would need to know the containers size. Also I would need to know how much vinegar to put in. I would need to know how long to wash with water for.
-1	China's panda and Australia's koala bear are both specialist. They are both different from pythons because pythons are generalist. It's also a invasive species.
-1	The students should include in their procedure what shape the samples are in, are they all solids in the same shape, or are they ground upp the ammount of surface area will affect the rate of disintegration of the samples. Also, they should state how much vinegar should be put into the containers, and that the ammount of vinegar in each container should be the same. What type of vinegar it is should also be included.
1	The additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment would be first, naming the four different samples given to you. Secondly, you would need the amount of vinegar needed to pour into the containers and what kind of containers. Thirdly, you would need to know how you would determine the mass (example, with an electric balance). The students need to be more specific on their materials.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because both are specialists, and they both only eat pretty much one food. Pandas exclusively eat bamboo while koalas almost exclusively eat eucalyptus leaves. Both the panda from china and the koala from Australia differ from pythons because pythons are generalists who can live pretty much anywhere and survive while koalas and pandas are specialists.
-1	How much vinegar should they put on each containers.
-1	"In order to replicate the experiment, you need the starting mass, the ending mass and the difference in mass. For example, the marble starting mass is ""9.8"" the ending mass is ""9.4"" and the difference in mass is ""0.4."" Now for the limestone, the data the group of students got was ""10.4"" for starting mass,""9.1"" ending mass, ""-1.3"" difference mass now for the wood students got ""11.2"". Starting mass ""11.2"" ending mass and 0.0 for difference mass."
1	To replicate their experiment there are three pieces of information missing. How much vinegar they used, how big the containers were and what they were made of and what samples they used. If they added those things in the procedure you would be able to replicate their experiment.
1	Just based off of the procedure, you would need to know how much vinegar to put into each container as it never a list then correct amount. You'd also need to know what in use as a container, as some may be too large or small to get an accurate result. You'd also need to know the starting mass of each sample, and what the samples are.
-1	The most weak sample was limestone because  it lost 1.5g of mass. The other don't have much difference .The stranger samples in the Acid Rain is wood because didn't lost a gram.
-1	A panda from china and a koala from Australia are very simmilar because they are both specialists. Panda's only eat bamboo and koalas exclusively eat eucalyptus leaves.This shows that they are unable to adopt , unlike a python whose habitat in Asia is simmilar to those in about a third of the continental united states.
-1	I cannot draw a conclusion because important information is missing from the table. The students could have improved the test by adding in the plastic length to the data table. They also could have included the ammount of weight the weights weigh.
-1	"As stated in the article "" A specialist is China's panda, which eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's koala bear, which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively"" the python on the other hand is generalist it eats anything and lives almost anywhere koala's and pandas do not."
-1	The first thing that I would need in order to replicate the acid rain experiment, is my 4 different samples. The next thing I will need is the vinegar to pour on our 4 samples the last thing I need is a slaceal to measure the start mass (g) and the ending mass(g) to find out the difference in mass(g).
-1	A Panda in China and a Koala in Australia are different from pythons because pythons are carnivores meaning they eat nothing but that. And the Panda and Koala are. Herbenioires meaning they eat leaves and grass staff like that. The panda eats bamboo and the Koala eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively.
-1	Additional information would be doing the experiment 3 times before putting the data down.
1	More information would be needed to replicate the experiment. It needs to be explained what the samples are of. It should say how much vinegar to use. Also, it should be stated where to put the samples submerged in vinegar. There should be a control included within the experiment. Directions should be given to calculate the difference in mass.
1	To conclude this experiment. I would state that plastic B stretched the most. In trial 1 it stretched to 22 and in trial 2 it reached 23mm. Compared to plastic A reriching 10mm. To improve the students experiment I would have them make sure that when they put the plastic bag dawn they put it at the same space for a more accurate answer. And lastly, they could hold more trials to improve validity of the experiment.
1	You have to make sure that you are very specific when writing a procedure. Some additionally needed information would be in step 1, what measurement are you having the mass in (g, kg). In step 2 you need to give a precise amount that you are putting in the containers. (for example 10ml). Another thing is in step 3, what are you labeling the cups saying you need to specify. Lastly, in step 6 you need to put a measurement of what mass is to be calculated in.
-1	Both panda's from China and koalas in Australia eat constantly. And there different from pythons because they do not eat as much species as a python does. There also different because in paragraph 20 it says that pythons are generalist. And pandas from China, or koalas from Australia aren't.
1	a) To conclude, plastic type B is the most stretchable out of all four types of plastics. Type B stretched 22 mm on T1, and 23 mm on T2 (average of 22.5 mm) while type A and C ranged between 10 mm and 11 mm, and type D 20 mm. Type A was the most stretch resistant, so this type of plastic would be the best for grocery bags so that food doesn't fall out. ^p Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design is by including how much the weights attached to the clamp on the plastic weighed, and how long the plastic should be for each type. Should it be the same or different.
1	In order to repeat the experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar was needed in each container, how big each sample should be and where to store the experiment for 24 hours so that the experiment does not get ruined & due to the sorroundings it was in.
-1	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are both similar. They are both similar because as said in the article they are both specialist that need to inhabit certain areas because they only eat a certain food. But they are different from pythons because pythons are able to inhabit different climates and eat different foods as other generalist animals.
-1	"Pandas and koala bears are similar because they are both ""specialists"". This means they must inhabit a specific area for its specific resources and climate. For example, a panda eats mostly bamboo, and a koala bear will eat eucalyptus leaves ""almost exclusively"". Unlike these animals that require particular circumstances to survive, the python is a ""generalist"". This means it can thrive in a variety of climates and resources."
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists and depend on certain foods that they can't survive without. They are both different from pythons because a python is a generalist and can live anywhere and change can benefit it, but specialists need stability.
-1	a) A conclusion of this procedure would indicate the plastics durbility to a certain amount of weight and which if the plastics is more durable or unstretched than the others. ^p b) One way the students could have improved the experimental design would be stating the types of plastic used. Another way would be by determining how heavy the weights were on the clamps.
-1	"There are similarities between China's panda and Australia's koala including the fact they are both ""specialists."" ""A specialist is  China's panda, which eats .... bear, which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively."" Says the article. These two species are confined to their specific habitat while the python, a ""generalist"" can adapt to almost any location."
1	After reading the group's procedure, additional information that a would need in order to replicate the experiment are that a need to know the size of the containers that the samples are put in, for they need to be identical. U also need to know tha amount of samples u need to put in each container in order to obtain tha same starting mass the group of students recieved from the samples. Another factor a should know is the amount no vinegar that u pour into the containers concerning the oud example of the experiment. Another good peice of information would be the location where the samples are drying and amount of sunlight.
-1	"Pandas and koalas are both specialist species each eat and live in 1 place. The article said ""A specialist is China's panda, which eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia koala bear, which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively."""
1	Out of both trials plastic type B got the longest after experiment. It streched out to 22mm in trial A and 23mm in trial B. Plastic type A stretched out the least. In trial A it reached 10mm and in trial B it reached to 12mm. ^p Two ways the students could have improved the validity of their results would be to add in the original lengths of the plastics in their data table. They could of also gave the names of the plastics instead of using letters.
-1	Pandas and koalas are specilist species because they rely on stability to live while the pythons is a generalist species that can survive in multiple places.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to kolas in Australia because pandas only eat bamboo and kolas only eats eucalyptus. Pandas and kolas are different from pythons will eat anything for example in paragraph 14 python swallowed an alligator.
-1	China's panda are different to Australia's koala bear because panda eats almost nothing but bamboo. And koala bear eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively.
-1	Pandas and koalas are similar because they both live in mild areas where its warm. They also eat one type of food. Pandas eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koala in Australia because they only eat one type of food. A panda only eats bamboo and a koala bear only eats eucalyptus. They are also similar because a panda and a koala bear are leave specialist, pythons are generalist.
-1	The plastic that streched the most would be plastic type A because it went from 10 to 12 when the others increased by one or none at all. The students could've tested more plastics, or use a different method to strech the plastic.
1	a) My hypothesis, that plastic type B would stretch the most was correct. B stretched on average 22.5 mm, while the other three ranged from 10-20mm. If I need a plastic with the largest stretchability, I would choose B. ^p b) The experiment would be more valid if I started with the same amount of each substance before doing the trials and it would also be more valid if I complete one or two more trials.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are very basic animals like the panda only eats bamboo and the koala eat eucalyptus leaves. They are different from phythons because phythons can live in almost any were in the south.
-1	The article says that pandas & koalas are similar because the only eat one thing. While pythons will eat anything they can fit in their mouth.
-1	You may also use a couple of samples incase you make a mistake while you are putting that one sample in that container. You never know you can mes up.
1	In order to replicate this experiment  I need to know the materials, what kind of sample material, and why are they doing the experiment. How much vinegar rinse or how long
-1	Pandas and koalas are similar because they are both described as specialist animals because they only eat one food exclusively; no change. The panda and koala bears a different from the pythons because because pythons are generalist animals, that migrate and can adapt to the climates in the Lower States, while the panda and koala bears cannot.
1	If I were to replicate this experiment ,I would need to know the following things that the students left out of their procedure: ^p 1.How big should the rock samples be? ^p should they be relatively the same size? ^p 2. How much vinegar should be poured into the containers? ^p 3.How long should the samples be rinsed with distilled water? ^p 4.Should the containers be made out of any specific material?
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialist. The pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo and the koalas eat eucalyptus leaves. These animals are different from pythons because pythons are dangerous in that they can eat and will eat almost everything.
-1	In order to replicate this experiment,I would need to know 3 more things that weren't stated in the procedure. I would need to know the amount of vinegar poured into the container,the amount of time the samples were in the vinegar and the amount of distilled water used to rinse it off.
1	In order to replicate this experiment the type or sample would need to be indicated in the procedure in addition the size of the containers would need to be used. Also the amount of material placed into each containers would need to be indicated.Lastly, the amount of vinegar added into the container should be included.
-1	After looking at the data I can conclude that plastic was D was the stronger the plastic because it stayed the same length. ^p B. two ways they could have improved the job is by first stating what type of plastic you are using and by saying how much weight you have to the clamp.
-1	The Panda in China are similar to Koalas in Australia b/c they eat the very good plants of their food sources are quite the same they are different b/c they will need to get used to their habitat.
-1	The information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is, why would you need identical containers, material and vinegar.
-1	In the article it says that panda bears mostly eat bamboo and Koala's mainly eat eucalyptus leaves. They are similar because they only eat o certain amount of food while snakes any pythons eat a lot of different things. The article even said that a python tried to eat an alligator.
-1	It has come to my conclusion that plastic letter B is the strongest. Plastic B showed that it has the strongest by consecutivley stretching the most. ^P B) First I would have don 3 trial because that always renders a more exccurat result than 2. Second I would mak sure all the plastics war the same length.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both have a specific diet. Like pandas and bamboo or koalas and eucalyptus leaves.
-1	In conclusion, plastic type B was the strongest plastic. In trial 1 it stretched to 22 mm while plastic D only stretched to 20mm and C to 14mm. In trial 2 plastic B stretched to 23mm while D only stretched to 20mm and c to 13mm. One way the student could have improved their experimental design was to stretch the plastic until it was about to brake to get the full stretchability. The student could have also done more trials to get more valid results.
-1	Pandas is similar to koalas because pandas eat bamboo and koala eat only eucalyptus leaves an they thought eat meat and python eat meat.
1	From the data given, I conclude that plastic B had the most strech ability and plastic A had the least. Two ways this experiments could be improved is by using the same size plastic for each type of plastic and by stating how many  he used.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both stay in one continent and don't move. They are both different from pythons because they don't eat the same food and pythons don't have legs and arms, but koalas and pandas do.
-1	Just like koala bears in Australia, panda bears are specialists, this means they can easily adapt to only a certain type of environment and they eat mostly one type of food. China's panda ''eats almost nothing but bamboo'' and Australia's koala bear ''eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively''(pg 5). These animals are both different from pythons because pythons eat a variety of foods and can live in many types of environments. Thus pythons are generalists, not specialists.
-1	"Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Astralia because they are both specialists that eat only one type of food ""China's panda which eats almost nothing but bamboo"". They are different from a python is a generalist."
-1	The information not included in the procedure that should be stated is the amount of vinegar added to each of the containers.
-1	The additonal information youwould need to know is; you would need to know if the rock was sitting in the vingeror being shaken. If shaken, you would need to know how hard to shake it. (different prosseces are created)
1	a) The plastic type B has the greatest stretchability out of the other 3 types. ^p b) The student should be clear about the length of each plastic to ensure that only independent variable is the type of plastic. Also, the student must determine the weight of the weights clamped on the plastic to keep one independent variable (plastic type). It is important to keep your constants, constant.
1	They should label the materials. Makes sure the scale is calibrated. Make sure you have a few days to do this lab
-1	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know what the students are looking for? Why each steps of the procedure is being done? Why those  four samples were chosen and if there should be more trials or repettions , in order to create more accurate data.
-1	A) Plastic A & B stretched down the same. Plastic C was not that stretched down at all. B.) Two ways the students could have improved their experiment would be to measure the plastic type before stretched down. They should have had tested the plastic in different times. For example. T1 in 5 mins, T2 in 10 mins, trial 3 15mins, etc until 30 mins.
-1	For the polymer investigation lab experiment my conclusion from the data is that plastic type B was the most breack resitance and streched the most at 22, 23 mm. Two ways the students could op improved the experiment is in procuder one. It said to measure the length should be a certain lengths for all the plastics. My second thing is how heavy are the weights in the experiment that hung on the bag.
-1	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know which sample is going in which container, you would need to record all of the masses of each sample and make sure all the masses are the same. You would also have to pour the same amount of vinegar on each sample.  After the 24 hours, rinseing samples and letting each sit for 30 minuets you would weigh each sample again and see which one is most different in mass.
-1	I dont think his stretchability investigation work. I feel that the student didnt has to exactly respect everything 3 times and they didnt have add weights to clamp and allow them hang.
1	After reading that group's procedure one additional piece of information you would need to replicate that experiment is what the four different samples were. Another thing you would need to know is how much vinegar you should put in with each sample. The last piece of additional information you would need is how big each of the samples should be.
-1	How a Panda bear in Chain is similar than koalas bear in Australia because in paragraph 21 it say that panda only bamboo and koala bear eat eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively how they both different from a pythons because jail breath in . they invasive species. Undergo a jorge never proliferting, what certain is that you.
-1	You would need to pour vinegar in each of 4 seperate, size, identical containers. Place a sample of 1 material into a container and lable do the same with the other samples.
-1	After reading the groups procedure, the additional information needed to replicate the experiment is a control because there is no control in the experiment. The type of containers needs to be known because the size can affect on how much vinegar is absorbed. Also,they do not mention how much the samples are, record so their experiment cannot be repeated with the hope of having the same results.
-1	a. The plastic that stretched the greatest has the plastic type B. Almost more than half the plastic types had stretched more the second trial. ^p b. This student should label the names of the plastic, not just, A-D.
-1	In order to deplicate this experiment, we would need to know how much vinegar the people used. If we don,t know and we use more or less, it could change the experiments outcome. Also , we would need to know all of the tools they used so that we could use the same ones. And finally, it would help if they measured the mass inbetween the 24 hours.
1	You would have to know how much vinegar to put into the containers. You would also have to know what environment  to put the cups in, in the sun would cause different effects than inside or in a shady area. ^p Lastly, you would have to know what you put then to and leave them on a paper towel inside, or on a table, etc.
-1	Panda in China are similar to Koalas because they both are specialist. This means according to the article there the most abundant and often do best around humans. They also have one main food source bamboo (panda) & eucalyptus leaves (Koala) they're both different from pythons because pythons are less supported making them a generalist.
-1	"Pandas in China and koalas are similar because they eat only one plant. The article states that pandas eat ""almost nothing but bamboo"" and koalas eat ""eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively."" They are different from pythons because pythons are dangerous and eat animals. one python ""swallowed an aligator."" Pythons are carnivores while pandas and koalas are herbivores."
-1	In conclusion some would strech alot and same wouldn't. They could improve it by adding more clamp or by streching it more.
-1	A.) When the four different polymer plastics were tested for stretchability a second time the results changed drastically for each material as shown in the data table. ^p B.) Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results was by increasing the time the material have to hang, and repeat the trial a third time.
-1	1.You will need on hypothesis. ^p 2.You will need a independent variable. ^p 3.You will need a dependant variable.
1	A) In conclusion polymer B, is the one that could stretch the most, and polymer A is the one who can't stretch as wide. ^P B) To make the validity of the experiment more accurate than they should of had exact measurment, for example in step 2, the could of said how much it should be hanging by. Also, the could of added another trial, it is always good to have 3 trials just in case of any mistakes.
1	Some additional information you would need to replicate this experiment would be how much vinegar should be put in each container. If not specified, someone may put too little  or too much, and the results can come out very differently. You would also need to know how much of each sample you need to put in the containers and you need to know how long to rinse each sample and where the samples should dry.
-1	They didn't come up with the independent &  dependent variable ^p - Make up a question ^p - Create a hypothesis
1	Plastic A was the strongest of the 4 plastics as it stretched the least while plastic D was the weakest as it stretched the most. ^P One way the students could of had a better experiment is to do more trials as it would give more precise data. The second way to improve the experiment would be to try the plastics in different conditions such as heat or cold to see if that affects the strength.
-1	"Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because their both specialist, pandas and koalas are both different from pythons because pythons are called generalist. In the article, ""one man's pet, another invasive species"" It truely explains that specialist in china such as panda's eat mostly nothing but bamboo and such as koala bear, they eat nothing but eucalyptus leaves. A generalist is a daccoon, a python a cockroach, a white tailed deer which is mostly located in Florida to Antartica."
-1	If trying to replicate this experiment, you would need more information. You need to know how much vinegar to poor into the containers. You will also need to know what to label your container. How do you determine the mass of the samples when trying an experiment, you need  to make sure that you have all of the correct  information before starting your project.
1	Some additional information that you would need is how many vinegar are you pouring in. Also in step 3 it says add a sample of each material. We need to know how big the sample would have to be. Something that could effect the data could be what temperature are you putting this experiment in, is it room temperature, we need to know this.
-1	They didn't include the temperature of the containers. They didn't have trials of testing.
1	A) Based on the students data plastic B is the most stretchability and plastic A is the less stretchable plastic. ^p B) In the students' experiment they could of stated exactly what was the measurement of the first type of plastic so they can repeat it acceratly for the other plastics. They could of also detemen the exact weigh of the clamp and how much wighed the wightes they add to get an more accerated result for the stretchability of the plastics.
-1	The Chinese panda and koalas  are both specialists. They have a stable diet of one food and only one. Pythons are generalists , according to the actions they adapt easier because they can live off and they unlike the specialists who eat food for one place in the world.
1	Based on the data the B type plastic is the most stretchable. In the first trial it was stretched 22mm and in the second 23mm. The student could improve the experiment by through, if he tells us which amount of weight he used. Also the student could try the experiment for a longer period of time and then do this experiment than twice.
1	They should add how much vinegar to pour into the container, and how large the container must be as well. Another thing they might want to add is the concentration of vinegar that is poured in whether 100% or 50% or something alse to find mass you would also need to find volume.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both only eat spefic foods. As the article said pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo and koala bears eat almost nothing but eucalyptus leaves. They are different from pythons because unlike pythons,mostly are restricted to live in one area, but to their diet.
-1	To replicate this experiment first off I have to know which sample is which. When recording the mass I will not know which belongings to the correct sample. Also it does not tell us in what metric unit we are measuring the samples with, so this needs to be clearer. Last of all, in order to replicate this experiment I need to know how much vinegar needs to be added into the containers, because different amounts of vinegar can change the results. Last of all in step 4 it tell us to remove the samples, but I do not know ways to remove those samples, in a seperat cup or container?
-1	Pandas in China eat only bamboo and koalas feed exclusively on eucalyptus trees in Australia. Both are specialists because they can only survive on one type of food. Pythons are generalists in contrast, because they can adapt to different food sources depending on their environment. The panda and koala are specialists while the pythons are generalists.
-1	After reading this procedure, I would advise these students to make step 3 easier to understand. In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to label what material is going into the container, what you're labeling it, and what single sample enters the container in the end. Also, to make this experiment more reliable, you would need to add more trials to your procedure. Also, if you were just looking at your procedure and not the table, you would need to identify the four samples in step one.
1	A: Based on the data I can conclude that plastic B had the most stretchability it stretched 22 and 23 mm. C 14 and 13mm and D 20,20 mm were in between. ^p B. One way the student could have improved their experiment design is to clerify everything. What plastic, how long are they etc. They could improve their validity by doing three trials instead of two.
-1	3. a) Plastic A and C have very similar inatups based on the amount they stretched, and likewise with plastic B and D. ^p b) The entire procedure is vague and contains no actual numbers. One way they could have improved would be if, they specified the amount of weight they used to get this results they got; And the way , just to help the people trying to reperform this experiment this experiment would, would be to specify which platics are done at which time.
-1	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they are specialists. Pandas eat nothing except bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. They are different from pythons because pythons are generalists. They can adapt to new environments and do not have a restrictive environment.
-1	After testing four different polymere plastics. Plastic type A,B,C.D for their stretchability based on the data table plastic type A stretched 10mm, 11 and 12 mm. T2 plastic B stretched 22mm,T1 and 23mm.T2 plastic C stretched 14 mm 11 and 13mm, T2 and plastic D stretched 20 mm 11and 20 mm T2. Showig me that plastic B has the most stretchability and plastic A has the least.Two ways the student could have improved the experiment was including a control to have something to compare the stretchability of the plastics to, and state what each plastic was.
-1	Pandas in China are similar from koalas in Australia because they are both specialists. Also they both have their specific diets, bamboo and eucalyptus leaves. These animals are different from pythons because pythons are generalists. Generalists do best in and around humans, that makes them more abundant in that place.
1	After the the mRNA leaves the cells nuclaer envolope throught the pores in the envolope the m RNA seeks out a ribosome ( an organelle that synthisize protien based on the codons it get for the messenge RNA)  to synthisize the proteins it has codons for. After the mRNA finds a ribosome to synthisize the proteins it attaches on to the ribosome for it to read the codon sequance it contians. A codone is a sequence of three molacuole of nueclear acid that when read stand for one amino acid ( Amino Acid- the building blocks for proteins) As the ribosomes read the codon sequence, the ribosome calls tRNA to retrive the amino acids it need to create a protien chain. After a protein chain has been made the mRNA has no more use and it desolves back into the cytoplasm. After the protien chain has been fully synthisied it get sent to the rought endoplasmic reticulum to have final touches added to it. After all the final touches are added to the protein chain, it is then sent to the golgi apparatus to be prepare to be shipped out to another part of the body. After the golgi apparatus has prepared the protein chain to be shipped out it is then sent to the cell membrance to exit through a protein channal. After the protein has exited the cell it is shiped off else where in the body to be used
-1	"Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar in a way that they are dependent on food from their native land. They are specialists. ""A specialist is China's panda, which eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's koala bear, which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively."" They differ from pythons because pythons can adapt to different foods."
-1	You should in all procedures out in an actually experiments.
-1	a) Some plastics could stretch alot more than others. Plastic B stretched the most. ^p b. The students could added different weights on it and see if that changed the results.
-1	Pandas and Koalas are similar in the way they are both specialist. The panda of China can only eat bamboo and the Koala of Australia eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. These are both different from python which us a generalist which means they can live and adapt better in many places.
-1	Based on the students data plastics type D stretched the most in both trials. Two ways the students could have improved the experiment design is one way they could of have one more trials and see the results. Another thing they could have done was try to stretch the plastic over a different type of texture.
-1	After reading the group's procedure, to replicate this experiment, I would need a scale, four identical containers, vinegar,  a sample of marble,a sample of limestone,a sample of wood, a sample of plastic , a stop watch, water and labels.
1	A) From the student's data, we can conclude that plastic type B has the most stretchability, stretching an average 22.5mm per trial, compared to type D's 20mm, type C's 13.5mm and type A's 11mm. ^p B) One way the student could have improved is by increasing the number of trials carried out which will increase data accuracy and lessen the effect of outlians. A second way he could've improved is by stating the weight of the weights he used. Not specifying this could lead to variations of data, and almost impossibility to replicate the experiment.
1	First, the mRNA leaves the nucleus and a ribosome attatches to it. Second, the ribosome reads every three nucleotide sequence, or codon, and calls for a tRNA molecule that has an anticodon to compliment the codon. Third, after this process is repeated, the amino acids on the tRNA molecules form peptide bonds with each other, forming a protein. Finally, after the mRNA is translated until a stop codon, the protein is released and used in the cell as needed.
-1	In order to replicate this groups procedure, you would need to know the independent and dependent variables as well as the control group for the procedure. Also, to ma ke it more clear, they would need to include a hypothesis of the experimenting well as a purpose.
-1	The second trial 2 of the plastic stretched a little more. One actually decreased a mm. The student should've done it a better way instead of taping it to side of the table. Also they could've have much weight they were adding to the clamp.
1	Plastic type B stretched the furthest in both trials-meaning that it had the largest stretchability. One way that the student could have improved the experiment would be to specify, (and include in the procedure or clarify in this data table) if that was the the dermensions of his plastic samples. That way, same, the able would be the results were strictly describing and comparing the stretchability of the samples, and there were an outside source trying the outcome. Another way he could improve the validity of his lab, is regulate how much weight he added to the clamp and a lot include that in his procedure or data table in order to present his experiment more clearly.
1	In order to replicate the experiment we would need a control. We would also need the four samples to use. And another thing is what can of vinegar to use and how to weigh the mass of each one. That is what we would need to replicate the experiment.
-1	Plastic Type C stretched the most in both of its trials and plastic Type A stretched the least in both of the trials. The students could have allowed the plastics to long longer than 5 minutes, incase it takes some plastics longer to stretch. The students also could have used plastics that all had the same length to begin with, to eliminate all chances of error.
-1	a)  Based on the data, both trials have the same stretchability. ^p b) The students could have stretched both plastics at the sametime. Also record how heavy, the clamps are.
-1	The plastic streched more and more each time. ^p I think that the student could have been more specific when writing out the steps because it would have been easier to understand the data.
-1	Well they improved by making the right design and following the right instructions.
1	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know first what question the students are trying to answer and what the purpose of the lab is. Then, I would need to know what the three samples are. I would also need to know how much vinegar to put in each container and how large a sample of each material to use. The amounts are not specified. Finally, it would be helpful to know if a control should be used and what it should be.
-1	My conclusion would be that plastic type (D) would be the most strechy because it went up to 20mm with out tearing. Two ways students could have make the experiment by one cutting a determined length for all four plastics and recording the time it took  to stretch .
-1	Pandas in china are similar to koalas in Australia because they both almost always eat the same thing. In the article it says Chinas panda which eats almost nothing, but bamboo & Australia's koala eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. They differ from pythons because
-1	To uptake this groups experiment I would need an additional information. I would need to know how much vinegar to add the containers, also I need to know how much of each sample to pour in the containers. And lastly I would need to know what to unlike on the containers.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koala bears in Australia beause they both eat plants and try to stay out of harms way. On the other hand pythons are different because they will eat anything from mice to alli gators and kill what is ever in its path.
-1	Pandas in China and Koalas in Australia are specialists because they eat one type of food almost exclusively. Pythons are different because they are generalists and can therefore survive in environments other than their natural habitat.
1	Say what kinds of materials there using. Why there doing are experiment.
-1	This group of students did not include many important information that was needed in order to replicate this lab experiment. One additional information they could have added was the messures in which they determined the mass of the four different materials, did they use a scale of a halause. Another additional information was the amount of vinegar poured into the contain, these students did not specify how much vinegar to pour which can definately change the outcome of the experiment. Lastly, the students did not create a control from which they can compare their results with.
-1	From the data I concluded that type D plastic type holds its plastic under weight staying at 20mm, and type A plastic type was the worse dropping 2mm. They should've test the bags wit a variety of weight. Also I would've done one more trial to see if the numbers stayed constant.
1	In this experiment students tested to see
-1	"Pandas in China are similar to koala bears in Australia because they are both ""specialist."" For example, they both eat (almost) one specific type of food, with pandas only eating bamboo, and the koala only eating ""eucalyptus leaves"". The article also classified python as a generalist, because it can live anywhere as long as as it has similar conditions its Asian homeland."
1	"A.Plastic B stretched the most, D the second most, C the second least and A the least.^p B. for one student cased have included more trials only two trials is not that many and could have found and take results. More trials would have increased the validity. For another, the inident have specified the weight of the ""weight""in the procedure leaving that unspecified leaver that variable incontroiled, therefore therefore specifying the weight of the weight would have been highly been held to both the experimental to design and the validity."
1	A. Polymer plastic B had the most stretchability of 23mm. 11mm more than plastic type A, 10mm more than plastic type c, 3mm more than the stretchability of plastic type D. By having more improved trials. They should have made sure all the plastic types had the same measure in length and width. and they could have tested more types of plastics.
-1	The additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is after you did the experiment find out the mass again,do everything you did already but start with the information you already have,then determine the mass you end up with,and the difference in the mass. That's how I would replicate the experiment.
-1	In this group's procedure, some additional information should've been what were the labels named.
-1	"Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both really only eat one type of food. Unlike pythons who eat everything if their hungry. According to the article, ""China's panda, which eats nothing but bamboo, or Australia's koala bear, which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively."" In other words everyone has their own to able but they are for aspect."
-1	To replicate this experiment you would need to state you problem. What is the person for this lab also you need to indicate your independent and dependent variables.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists. Another similarity between the two is that they both feed to one specific plant. Pandas and koalas are different than pythons because a python is a generalist. Also a python has more than one food source that is not plant or vegetation.
-1	After reading the expirement, I realized that the additional information you need to replicate the expireiment is one, the amant of vinegar you poured in each container, two, label the containers before you start yar expirement and three, write a conclusion to make sure yar results are accurate.
-1	Koalas and pandas are similar because they both eat rear plants. China's panda which eats almost nothing but bamboo or Australia koala bear which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusive. They are different from pythons because pythons are reptiles and they are carnivores.
-1	A panda bear is similar to a koala bear because they both are specialist. Also panda bears eat nothing but bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively where pythons are generalist.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia, because panda eats almost nothing but bamboo, and koalas eats eucalyptus leaves all the time. They are different from pythons because pythons are 5 of the most dangerous species. The U.S. biological survey notes that pythons in Asia inhabit climates that are similar to those in about a third of the continental US.
1	1. mRNA floats to a ribosome (rRNA) in the cytoplasm and reads three bases (codon)2. tRNA matches up with proper amino acids and then pulls its amino acids to the ribosome and lines up its anitcodons with the codons3. RNA moves forward and realeases three bases at a time and the tRNA then realeases its amino acids and drifts away.4. The amino acids bond (peptide bond) and form a chain of amino acids which is now a protein. the protein then goes and does its job in the body.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to Koala in Australia because they both only eat food type of food in their natural habitat. They are both different from pythons because pythons just need to have  the right climate to survive  and they will adapt to the different food. For example Pandas only eat bamboo but a python will eat anything.
-1	The pandas in China and the koalas in Australia is said to be similar and different because in paragraph 21 it says a specialist is China's panda, which eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's koala bear, which eat eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively.
1	You would need to know what the four different samples are. Also you need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers. Lastly, you need to know what temperature to store them at.
-1	a) Plastic type A was strethier because on the first trial it streched out to 10mm and in the second trial it streched out to 12mm. It had streched longer, but plastic type D seems to have been stronger, it only streched 20mm through out both of the trials.
1	To replicate this experiment you will need to also include what type of sample to get. I could get any thing I saw and it would fit the description in the procedure. You also need to include how big the containers should be and how much vinegar to put into them. You should also include how to find the mass using what measuring system.
-1	"Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they both have a invalid food sorce. The pandas eat common food sorce is mainly ""only"" bamboo and the koalas is eucalyptus leaves. Compared to a python, a koala and panda's food sorce is totally different. A python eats almost anything alive such as rats, cats, deer, etc. The article even informs us about it eating an alligator."
-1	After reading the groups procedure there were many piece of information they could have added. One by showing how much vinegar was used in the test tube. Another reason is for step number three the group could of showed what they used as their control. The group did not mention a control. If there was a control it would have been all the same material but instead of vinegar the could ofused water. Lastly the group could have shown that they used two or more trials.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because both countries have similar climates and the are different from pythons because a python is kind of a wild animal.
-1	To replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar was put into each cup. You should also use the same mass as in the original experiment. And you would have to know how much water to use or might have to allow more time for it to dry.
-1	"Pandas from China and koala from Australia are very similar in the sense that they are both ""specialist"". These animals earns ""stability"" in life, they live of basics that surround them. However they are very different from pythons because pythons are ""Generalists"", they favor change. Pythons can live where ever the climate is right and quickly adapt to it. If you took a panda or koala out of it natural habitat they would most likely die. On the other hand a python would prosper and build off life from there."
-1	Additional information I would need to replicate this expiriment is how to determine the mass of each sample, also to take the masses of the samples before putting them in the vinegar & to compare the masses of before vinegar &after.
-1	Pandas and koalas are similar because the both eat mainly on thing which is stated in paragraph 21 pandas eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves. They both are different from pythons because pythons eat anything and is also cold-blooded.
-1	Both Pandas and Koalas are alike because they will only eat certain foods. Pandas will only eat bamboo and Koalas will only eat eucalyptus leaves this makes both animals specialists. They differ from Pythons because pythons unlike Pandas or Koalas, will eat anything even a alligator.
-1	Conclusion: The stretchability of a type plastic is dependent on what type of polymer it is. Plastic A and B were clearly strong than plastic C & D most likely they were made of very different polymers. ^p The students could have improved their design by specifying the weight and using the same weight and clamps every time. This would ensure more precision.
-1	Some additional information you would need to know is what samples you have to place in the vinegar. In order to complete the investigation you would need to know how to weigh the sample and what to use to do it. You also have to do some math to get the difference in mass.
-1	a) After evaluating the student's data, it appears that plastic type A stretches the least (10mm- 12mm) and plastic type B stretches the most (22mm-23mm). Therefore sample B is the most stretchy.^p b) The student could have improved the experimental validity by specifying how heavy the weights were that were being added to the bags. Another way to improve the experiment design would be yo test the experiment in multiple trials, using a different length of time each trial.
-1	B) The student could have possibly added more weight to each trial that they did to get more reasonable and noticeable results. The results shown below aren't as aromatic as you can see. Also, the student could have added more time for each time he repeated the investigation.
-1	To replicate the expirement I would need to know how much vinegar to put in each cup and how much of each sample.
-1	Pandas and koalas are similar because they are both bears that dont eat anything else but plants. In paragraph 21 says pandas eats nothing but bamboos and koala eats eucalyptus. Therefore, the python is different because the python is a reptile.
-1	What I would need it to maybe is to let the samples sit and dry for more than 80 minutes ^p Also multiply the last row for starting mass, ending mass, difference in mass. Be they repeat it.
-1	More you could repete the expierement just see it.
-1	Each type of plastic stretched about the same or a couple millimeters off to its counterpart in the second trial. The students could have improved the design by getting and telling specific types of plastic to use and to tell us what unit of measurement to measure the unstretched and then stretched plastic.
1	Based on the students data, I can examin that plastic type D was prefarrened correctly because the 2 trials recorded the same length but plastic type B stretched farthest. Two ways the student could improve the experimental design/or validity is to create more trials to test the stretch and also state the weight size and make sure he put the exact weight measure for each plastic type and trial tested.
-1	This procedure should state the materials that they are using to gather the materials. First it has to say to put on their eye protection. It also needs to state how one would go about determining the mass of the four samples. Lastly, there needs to be a step on how to find the difference in the masses and to remind the reader to record their results.
1	1.A list of materials and safety requirements. ^p 2.The amount of vinegar to put in the containers. ^p 3.The temperature of the room/vineger ^p 4.A control group.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia is because both animals hardly ever eat anything.
-1	Based on the students data it is concluded that their  wasn't much stretchability from the plastic samples. Sample A increased 2mm from T1 to T2. Sample B increased 1mm from T1 to T2. Sample C decreased by 1mm from T1 to T2. Sample D stayed the same in T1 and T2. This experiment could be improved if the student had a control which would be the measure of each plastic sample without any weight added.They could also repeat the experiment.
-1	(A) In conclusion, based on the students data, the plastic samples stretched slightly more in the second trial. Plastic type D was the only plastic that kept its length constant. (B) To improve the validity of the results I would've measured the plastic's width. To improve the design, I would've used a fifth plastic type to expand my results.
-1	Wood starting mass (g) 11.2
1	Cells can use osmosis which is the diffusion of water across a cell membrane.Cells can use facilitated diffusion which is the movement of particales across a membrane.Cells can use passive or active transport. Active has to do with proteins on the membrane called channel protein, this uses energy.  Passive transport does not use channel proteins, nor does it use energy.
-1	(A) Plastic type B was able to hold the most weights for each trial. ^p (B) Two ways they could have improved the experiment or validity is doing more trials for each plastic or they  could have let the plastic hang for longer than just 5 minutes.
-1	A) My conclusion from this expiriment is that plastic type A is flexible. B is somewhat flexible, C as well and type D isn't flexible at all. ^p B) The students could improve by being more detailed in things, like the weight of the clamp itself & including a control of each plastic.
-1	China's panda eat almost nothing but bamboo and Australia's koala beer eats eucalyptus leave eucalyptus: alrre of genes.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists. Both eat almost nothing but a certain type of plant from their native lands. Both koalas and pandas are different from pythons in that, according to the author, pythons are generalists. They are able to live in many places though small adaptations such as eating whatever animals they can find.
-1	Pandas and Koalas are both alike because they are specialists. They both consume a primary food. For example pandas' diets are mainly made up of bamboo; Koalas diets mainly consist of eucalyptus leaves. They differ from pythons because they can only live in places where their primary food source is present.
1	You would need to know how much vinegar was put in to each sample, find the size and shape of the container so the same amount of vinegar was actually covering the sample. You would need to know the shape or volume of sample because the surface are has to be the same so the same amount is affected by the vinegar.
-1	Well because China panda they don't eat almost nothing just bamboo and koala just eat eucalyptus so that is a food that they can jus find in their own ecosistem but in the case of the pythons they can eat almos everything like rats, cows, chicks, eggs etc.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both a specialists who need very specific environments to survive. They are different from pythons because pythons are generalists that can live close to almost anywhere.
1	1. A ribosome attaches to the mRNA (rRNA). Translation Occurs;2. Codons are coded for a specific amino acid.3. Anticodons that are in the tRNA are paired with the codons in the mRNA. 4. Peptide bonds are formed between the amino acids after translation has occured. New proteins are made.
-1	They should have told what they were using to weight the materials and they should of said how much vinegar to use.
-1	"A) A conclusion that I have concluded from the data table is: plastic type ""B and D"" were stretched the most leaving type ""A and C"" being the most durable types of plastic.^p B) Two ways that the students could have improved there experiment design/ or validity are: more trials for more accuracy. And more plastic types to experiment with to actually find out which one is the most durable."
-1	The additional information I would add would  be to record the data at the end of the procedure. Find the average of the samples. To find the difference in the objects that were placed in the container.
-1	"In the procedure you would need to add the time in which the stone / rock / plastics began to change when vinegar was added to them. They could have to explain when they would change or what time for each one :marble, limestone, wood and plastic. In the procedure it only explained ""After 24hrs"" but they didn't write down the time difference for each one they only put the overall time."
-1	Measure the amount, after the 24 hours. Place the 4 different samples in 4 different places temperatures and leave samples in their area to dry.
-1	In order to replicate this experiment, you need to know how much vinegar to pour into the container and whether it's the same amount for each. In order for the experiment to be replicated, the students need to do 3 or more trials for each to gain reilabilly.You also need  have a control, which would be one of each placed in distilled water.The mass of each material should relatively close so that there isn't a drastic change in mass are to bigger placed or material.
1	a) I concluded that his clab is valid based upon doing multiple trials. I also noticed that the most stretchable was B and the least was A.^P b)Though two trials is good, it is best to do a third trial or fourth trial would be best. Also I think that they should have measured the length of the plastic before and have it on the the data table to compare the changes the occured in the plastics.
-1	Same additional into that would be needed is how much vinegar should be poured into each container. I would also like to know how much distilled water was used and finally there should be something show who this is determining in the whole procedure to doesn't talk about acid rain once.
-1	In conclusion the students data show that when the plastic was stretch each material stretched only 1-2 mm. This is not a very big change in length. The data also showed that for one of the plastics after stretched lost a mm of length. So this was not a very succsecfull lab. ^P One thing that they could do to improve this is to tell us what kind of plastic to use so the experiment is easier to test and also to have a control variable to really see the change in plastics.
-1	The additional information I would need in order to replicate this experiment is 1) To gather all the materials. 2) Tell how much distilled water, how big each container was. ^p 3) Record data.
1	a. Plastic type B stretched the most out of all the plastics. Therefore plastic type B is the weakest. ^P b. two ways the students could have improved their experiment is clampy how much weight is put on to the clamps. Also, they should do one more trial to make the experiment more accurate.
-1	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know the group's hypothesis and whether it was retreat or incorrect. This will help one to eliminate their thinking if they were wrong or to confirm their hypothesis. I would also need to know how much vinegar to put in each container, and whether all the containers contained an equal amount of vinegar. Lastly, I would need to see results from a controlled experiment, such as a rock with water and make sure it does not decay.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to Koalas in Australia because they are both specialists animals. There are not a lot of them and they both only eat one thing. Pandas eat bamboo, while Koalas eat eucalyptus leaves. Both of these animals are different from pythons because pythons are abundant and will eat anything that they can get their rangs into. They are generalists.
-1	Need to know how much vinigar to put in each container, how you are going to get the mass of the sample and how they are going to calculate the difference should be included in the students procedure.
1	One piece of additional information that I would need to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar that should be poured in each of the four containers. This is important because thew vinegar is what caused the samples to lose mass, so the amount of mass lost in each sample.If the amount of vinegar is inconsistent, then the data won't be valid. I would also need to know the amount of each sample needed and the mass of the container.
1	Use the same material that is used for the experiment.
-1	The way that pandas and koalas are alike is that they typically tend to eat one type of food.P-andas like to and always eats bamboo for there.1 thing to eat koalas always eats eucalyptus leaves for there food.The any pandas and koalas are different from pythons are that pandas and koalas are vegaterians  while pythons are carnivorous and only eat meat.
-1	Both pandas and koalas are the same because they only eat one thing. They are different from pythons because pythons snack on whatever they can get the hands like a snake for example or an alligator.
-1	Pandas in China and the koalas in Australia are similar because they are both specialist. Also they both eat some type of plant liker pandas eat almost not but bamboo and koala bear eat leaves. Pythons are generalist not only that but they also eat other animals.
1	Based upon the students data, + displays that plastic type B is the most flexible compared to the other three types of plastic. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design would be to do the standard 3 trials, instead of two and also to further improve the student's validing of their results would be to record a before and after measurement as well as the averages to his table to make his more more clear or valid.
-1	Panda bears and similar to Koalas because they both live in trees and they both eat plants. And they are both different because a python is a reptile.
-1	You would also need to include a list of supplies, a hypothesis and amounts of how much vinegar and of the samples is needed.
-1	China's Panda bear eats mostly bamboo and Australia's Koala eats leaves, the show no harm on other hand pythons eats pets and harm humans and cause a threat to America's animals.
1	They would need to state the four different samples that they are using. they also could have done different trials of the experiment, and they should put in the procedure to record the data that they got.
1	A conclusion that can be drawn is that plastic type B was the most stretchable of the plastics. The student could improve their experimental design would be to make sure all the different plastics were the same length before the weights were added, and make sure to include that original measurement in the data table. The student should also keep the number of weights on the plastic constant because if are plastic had more weight applied to it then another, it may appear to have stretched more.
-1	First, would want to know what materials i would be testing in the procedure, the students do not povide a clear explanation of what is being tested. Also, how do we move the samples without touching them with our fingers, they should specify if we need to use forces to move them or not. The acids on our fingers could affect the samples, they should also describe how to figure out the mass, the way they wrote the procedure makes it so that one would not know what device to use to figure their new mass.
-1	The additional information you would need to replicate this experiment is how much vinegar needs to be put in each container. An additional piece of information that would help replicate this experiment is how long should you rinse each rock for because some rocks may absorb water which would add on some weight.
-1	1) I would need to know how much vinegar is being put into the sample. ^p 2) What are they trying to find out through pass is to amount. ^p 3) Was there a control group in this experiment.
-1	The Pandas in China are very similar to the Koalas in Austrila by what they eat. According to the article pandas only eat bamboo as Koalas will only eat eucalyptus exclusively. They both differ from the pythons because they are carnivores and pandas and Koalas aren't.
-1	To replicate this experiment I would also need to know, in step two how much vinegar to pour into each containers. Otherwise you would not accurately be able to conduct this experiment.
1	I would need the amount of vinegar to put in each container. How long to rinse it in water (materials). And what kind of container casinial use.
-1	The conclusion came out to be that the 2nd trial wasn't really that much at a difference between trial 1. Most of them was 2 or 1 difference. D stood the same.
-1	Determine the ending mass, determine the difference in mass. Also the mass or everything marble, limestone, wood and plastic. You would need to add up all  three masses, starting, ending and the difference in mass, then you will get the answer to all of them.
-1	The additional information you need to replace the experiment. You need limestone, wood and plastic, marbles. You test all of them in different containers. It will give you the mass of the experiment. That is what it need to replace the experiment.
-1	The amount of stretched in T1 and T2 nie was a little different, T2 was greater than T1 in plastics A,B and C, but in plastic D they had the same amount of stretched. ^p What the student shoud do to improve his experiment is to add more trials.
1	a) Plastic type B is the stretchable polymer plastic. ^p b) The student should have specified a constant length to be used for each trial. Also, the students should have specified the weight being used.
1	The mRNA finds a ribosome to conduct protein synthesis on.  Once the mRNA finds the ribosome the AUG codon starts the protein synthesis.  Next, tRNA bring the correct anti-codons to the mRNA for the construction of the protein.  Once the tRNA have delivered the correct anti-codons they leave to go and be recharged and get more anti-codons.  The anti-codons are then paired up the the codons on the mRNA strand, and peptide bonds form between each of the anticodons.  When the stop codon is reached the protein is completly made.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists species. They are also similar because they only eat one kind of specific food.
-1	"Pandas in China and koalas in Astralia are similar because they both eat off of one primary food source which is different from the python who can eat almost any type of food anywhere. This is shown in the article in paragraphs 20-21 where is says that pandas eat ""almost nothing but bamboo"" and the koala eats eucalyptus."
1	Based on the data provided by the studence, I have concluded that plastic type B streched the most in both trial 1 and trial 2. ^p One way the studentce could have improved the experiment was by having a continuat for example they could have done a third trial  to see if there was anymore change. The second way the studentce could have improved the experiment was by giving the length of each plastic to see if they were the same.
-1	Additional information I would need in order to replicate the experiment would be how much vinegar for each samples, a control group and a dependent variable.
-1	"Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they mostly eat only one food. ""A specialist is China's panda, which eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's koala bear, which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively"". They are both different from a python because a python will eat anything which is a generalist."
-1	The additional information I would need is how to determine the mass of four different samples. It is well specified. Also I need to know how much vinegar to pour into different containers, then after the experiment is complete I would need to figure out how to determine the mass of the samples.
-1	Conclusion : Type D plastic has more stretchability because the a mount stretched is 20: T1 & 20: T2. On the first step the should be more specific for the type of plastic. & for the fift step should include in what direction to measure the plastic type after re moving the weights.
1	To replicate this experiment, I will need to know the size of the containers in which I should pour the vinegar, the amount of vineger and the size of the 4 materials.
1	"a. Plastic type B was the polymer plastic with the greatest stretch length. Plastic type A was the most resistant to stretch. b. The students need to make a couple of changes to improve the validity of the results. In step 1 of the procedure, it says ""take a sample of one type of plastic B measasure its length"". This is misleading because all 4 polymer plastics should be the same length at the beginning of the experiment. This is important b/c the longest should be the piece is at the beginning can affect how much it will stretch. Finally students need to change step 9 ""add some weights"" to a specific number of weight. This is important b/c if they put more weight on one plastic it will stretch farther, than a plastic w/ less weight attached."
-1	You would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container. You would also need to know how much of the sample material you should put in the containers. In addition you need to know how you would remove the samples from the containers weather you can touch them or have to grab them with something else.
-1	Based on the student's data, plastic type B stretched the most. In T1 it stretched 22mm and in T2 it stretched 23mm. On the other hand plastic type A stretched the least. In T1 it stretched 10mm and in T2 it stretched 12mm. So therefore type B and type D were pretty close to one another. ^p One way the student could have improved the experimental design is by specifying the amount of weight attached to each clamp. Another way is by also specifying the amount of the edge taped to the table.
-1	The aditional informatiou I would need to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar needs to be added to each identical containers, what kind of materials are being placed into the samples and know why the mass is being calculated.
-1	A. I conclude that plastic B worked the best because it held in most weight like 22,23 and the lowest was 10,12 so terefore plastic B works the best. ^P B. What they could have done was add more trials or change the type of cup.
1	Plastic type B is the stretchiest type of the 4 plastic types this student tested.^p (b)The student could've specified how many weights to add and how much each weight weighed.
-1	The pandas in China and the koalas in Australia are alike because they are both specialists. They both mainly eat one type food that is found in their habitat. On the other hand, pythons are generalists. They eat whatever they can find. In the article it states that generalists can live anywhere that is the main difference.
-1	"Plastic type ""B"" has the most stretchability after trials 1 and 2."
-1	A conclusion based on the data is that all the plastic types have ranged around the same number. Two ways the experiment could have been approved is for the different plastic types let the weight hold longer than five minutes. And change the trials.
1	One conclusion that can be based off the student's data is that plastic type B has the most stretchability out of all of the plastics tested.One way this student can improve the experimental design is to add more trials to the experiment. Another way is to set the length the plastic should be because having different plastic lengths can cause experimental error.
-1	After reading the group's  procedure, the group should add a hypothesis, controll, and objective.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia by both of them being a specialist. Also they both only eat one type of food. Pandas eat bamboo while koalas eat eucalyptus leaves as stated on paragraph 21. They also differ from pythons because pythons are generalist which is said on paragraph 20.
-1	The Panda bear looks almost like the Koala bear. The pythons have many different things about them than a panda or Koalas. They have no arms or legs, they're predators, and etc.
-1	Additional information you would need to replicate this experiment include the amount of each sample used; the materials used such as equipment to mass each sample and amount of containers needed. Also you would need to know the amount of vinagar poured on each sample.
1	I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the container and what type of vinegar to use. Also, they do not state what the four different samples are in their procedure which could cause confusion.
-1	In order to replicate the experiment, one would need to know some background information on the properties of marble, limestone, wood and plastic. Specifically, their chemical makeup and the elements contained in the samples. A second piece of information you would need to know is if there should be multiple trials. Thirdly, one would need to know the effect of acid rain on the samples physical properties in order to determine a valid hypothesis/conclusion.
1	1. After mRNA leaves the nucleus it travels to the ribosome where rRNA recognizes the mRNA strand and a start codon and coordinates the ribosome to attache to the mRNA.2. Once the mRNA is within the ribosome, sections of three nitrogenous bases are identified on the mRNA strand, otherwise known as a codon, and a corresponding anticodon attached to tRNA and an amino acid are signalled to attach.3.tRNA continues to attach itself to the mRNA strand via the identification process aided by codons and anticodons. In doing so the tRNA, which have attached amino acids, begin to form a string of amino acid that are attached together by peptide bonds to form a protein.4. Once the the protein has been formed, which is usually composed of around 20 amino acids, the ribosome comes to a stop codon which signals for the protein to be released from the ribosome. From there the protein then folds up into a three dimensional shape in order to function properly.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because these animals are harmless and are not a threat to human. Pythons or the other hand are a threat to humans so they are un welcome to society as pandas and koalas are more welcomed.
-1	"Pandas in china are similar to koalas in Australia because both animals eat almost same type of food and a only plants. According to the article, "" China's panda, which eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's koala bear  which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. Also Pandas & koalas are different from pythons because pythons are carnivores. According to the article, "" A python swallowed an alligator,"" Pandas and koalas eat plants and they eat mostly one type of plant, but pythons eat animals."
-1	Plastic polymer D has the most stretchability. It is more durable. Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design an validity of the results, would be to have a few more trials and test the plastics for 10 minutes.
-1	The way that pandas in china are similar to koalas in Australia and how they both are different from pythons is because, they both are specialists. They're different from a python because pythons are generalists.
-1	b. The students could have improved there experiment by making diffrent data graphs. They could have also improved there expriment by solving the resolts by adding or subtracting.
-1	Both China's panda bear and Australia's koala eat only one type of plant. Pandas eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves. They are different from pythons because pythons will eat any thing with four legs that moves. They're not picky eaters like the panda bear and koala.
-1	Chinas pandas eat mostly only bamboo and koalas mostly eat eucalyptus leaves and a python can eat almost anything even an aligator then explode and pytons can go all over and eat anything and koalas and pandas cannot.
-1	The two ways that the students could have improved on this experimental design is one what kind of plastic where they using and name each one. The second would be what would you measure the plastic. What type of measuring stick you would use or a triple beem balance. Also they could have dawn three trials to make there experiment valid.
1	In order to replicate the group's experiment I would have to know more information. For example, it says to put vinegar, but it doesn't say the measurement of how much would be needed. It would also have to say what type and what size container to put the vinegar in. Lastly, the procedure would also have to say what types of samples they would be placing inside the container with vinegar.
1	The first process used by cells to cross the membrane would be known as diffusion. Diffusion uses no energy when particles are moving from a concentration of high to low. If they are moving from a concentration of low to high then this does use energy. Diffusion continues until the membrane has obtained equillibrium on both sides.      The second process of cells moving across the membrane is known as osmosis. This is the same as diffusion only water molecules are attempting to cross the membrane. This type of diffusion is known as passive transport and requires no energy. Water needs to be moved in and out of the cell by osmosis to maintain homeostasis.     Facilitated Diffusion is the third process by which substances move across the membrane. This is done by a membrane protein and requires signal molecules to signal the protein to open and close. Once the substance has entered the membrane protein, the protein closes on the outside of the membrane and opens on the inside of the membrane, letting the substance in.
-1	The number incress for T2 most of the time. ^P Do another trial.
-1	"In conclusion to this data, I think plastic type B is the most flexible type of plastic. Also, plastic type A is the least flexible. ^p The students can improve their experiment by explaining how much of each plastic they should measure. For example, step 1 should say: ""Take 5cm of one plastic type."" Also, they could improve it by adding the weight of the clamp and letting it sit for longer than 5 minutes."
-1	According to the student's data plastic type B was able to stretch the longest with 23mm. Type D was close with 20mm but types C and A were for less stretchy with 14mm and 12mm respectively. The student should have specified how long the plastic sample should be eat. The student should have also specified how much weight was added to the clamps. For all I know, he would have used random lengths and weights for each trial so he should have been clearer in the procedure.
-1	Both panda's and Australia's koalas are similar. They both tend to only eat one food, being bamboo for panda's and eucalyptus leaves for koalas. They are also both specialists. Unlike pythons which are generalists. Also, pythons can tend to live in any enviornment, where koala's and panda's are mainly found in China and Australia. Koalas are similar to pandas, when they are both different to pythons.
-1	Pandas and koalas are both bears and they are not as as ressive as a python. Pandas and koalas dont stransle their pray like pythons do.
-1	"Pandas in China are very similar to koalas. Both are very different from pythons. "" With the assistance of technology can live anywhere"". Koalas can only live with eucalyptus plants, pandas can only live with bamboo. However, pythons can thrive on small vermin and can easily get by in the warmer climates in the Everglades."
-1	The conclusion that can be drawn from the label is that the second trial was more succesful at being stretched out. Two ways that the students could of improved the design of the results are increasing the amount of time the plastic was stretched. Also hey could of changed the amount weight was on the clamp to. To me it would be also helpful if a control was run to compare results.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to Koalas in Australia is they both eat type of plants. The Panda eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively (their both specialist) The difference between the two and a python is a python's s generalist. (They can live anywhere).
-1	To replicate the experiment, you would need to know the what the previous problem statement was, without a problem statement there is no purpose for doing the experiment. you would also need to know who the groups.... hypothesis was. By knowing the hypothesis you'll something to compete with your findings. And last the group should have said their control. ^p This will give you data to base your exams findings onto.
-1	Pandas and koalas are similar because they are only eating one type of food. This making them a specialist. Where as the python is eating everything it can, from aligators to the key largo wood rat which is a endangered species.
-1	Pandas are similar to koalas because both these species greatly rely on their habitat for survival. like the article stated , these animals survive due t o a single food source, which is only abundant where they live. This is unlike the pythons, who can move due with what they have for example, Pythons in the everglades have been known to eat species that only live there, like the key Lorez wood rat and once in a while, even an alligator.
-1	You would need vinegar, a sample material to put into a measurement and label them, also you would need four identical containers. This is to replicate the starting mass, ending mass and difference in mass. That is what you would need to replicate this experiment.
-1	According to the article, panda and koalas are similar because they are both specialists. Paragraph 21 says that they are specialists because they only eat one type of food. But both are are different from a python because pythons are more adaptable than pandas or koalas are.
-1	If I would replicate this experiment, I would add to the procedure that you need to weigh the samples before adding vinegar to them and determine the mass. I would also add that you need to calculate the difference between the masses. I would also add to the procedure that you need to add a certain amount of vinegar and should be the same for each sample.
1	Based on the results, plastic A is the least stretchable and plastic B is the most stretchable. The students could improve the experiment by giving the exact amount of weight to be used so that the experiment can be redone it needed. The student could also make each plastic sample the same starting length to rule out length as a variable.
-1	The additional information I would need to replicate this experiment is a watch, a measureing container, also some marbles, limestone, wood and plastic.
1	To replicate this, I need to know what samples I'm working with. It doesn't tell you how much vinegar to pour into each of the cups. If says after 24 hours remove samples from the containers, where do they go for 24 hours?
-1	The panda and the koala bear are similar because they only eat one type of plants and they are both bears. They are different from pythons because they don't live in Florida and they aren't reptiles.
-1	You would need something that measures more then measure it after the time is up there different coloured cups, so its easy to tell the different between the three cups in the same temperature because the temperature can slow and speed up the process.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koala bears in Australia because, for one reason they are types of symbolic animals in those countries. Also, the article said that they mainly eat just one type of food. Pandas and koalas are different from pythons because for one thing, they are not dangerous. Also, they only eat leaves mainly unlike in the article wen it said a python ate an alligator.
-1	From reading this students procedure and reviewing their data, I have realized some plastics are significantly better than others. The data shows that plastic type B that stretched 22mm and 23mm, and plastic type D stretched 20mm both times. Types B and C because that table shows A that stretched 10 and 12mm are type C stretched 14 and 13 mm. In conclusion, plastic type B and D are much stronger than A and C. b) Two ways they could have improved the experimental design is allowing them to hang for more than 5 minutes to get better data. Also, running a third trial will improve their results.
1	Additional information you would need to replicate this experiment is how much vinger to put in each container. Do you have to fill it or only put it so it reaches the top of the different materials? Also other info would be, what size containers do you need for this experiment. Lastly does it matter the material of the container: glass, metal. Throw away containers.
-1	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know how big samples to use. You would also need to know the problem or what you were testing for in the experiment.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists. Both have particular eating conditions because they both stick to eating only one type of food. Pythons are different to pandas and koalas because they are generalists, and can live in a wider range of places successfully.
1	Cells use processes to move substances across the cell membrane. Three ways to do this are active, passive, and diffusion. Active transport requires energy, this may use transport protiens. Passive transport does not require energy, the molecules just pass through the membrane. And diffusion is the the net movement of particles from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration.
-1	In order to replicate the experiment.You would need to know how much vinegar to pour ,you need to know how much distilled water and you aso need to know how your going to weigh it.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia since they are both specialists that eat a certain type of food almost exclusively. They are different from pythons because pythons can live anywhere and are most abundant in or around humans.
1	a) Based on the students data, plastic type B is the weakest plastic out of them all, and the strogest polymer plastic is plastic A because it was stretched the least. ^p B) The students could've included more discription on the plastic, like each plastics length or width, in order to show that everything was the same in length and width. Also the students should include in procedure on how many weights they used.
-1	You would need to know the amount of vinegar poured into the containers, what order to put samples in & take them out (allat once?), and how long to rinse for.
-1	Pandas eat only bamboo, koalas eat only eucalyptus leaves, pythons eat anything they can get into their mouth. Pandas and koalas are herbivores and eat only certain things.
-1	A specialist is china's panda which eats almost nothing but bamboo or Australia's koala bear which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. A python is a generalist arguably, a human being who with the assistance of technology can live anywhere that have become most abundant often those that do best in and around humans.
1	Some additional information that we would need in order to replicate this experiment is observations of what the samples looked like before, during and after the chemical reactions. Also, we would need to know the mass of the cup to make sure we are just calculating the mass of the four and lastly, you need to re-check your calculations.
-1	Both plastic types B and D stretched out of all the plastic types. He could have listed all materials first. Also he could have timed longer.
1	The plastic with the least stretch would be plastic A because it had a small change from 10mm to 12mm. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results are have the clamps and weights be the same ones everytime and make sure the plastic is on the side of the table not going on the top of the table.
-1	Determine the mass of four samples of what? How much vinegar is needed in the containers? You would need a scale to measure the different containers. Are the different containers made of the same material?
-1	Pandas and koala bears are similar pandas eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves. They don't eat meat. Pythons will pretty much eat anything. Pandas and koalas are both specialists,while a python is a generalist.
-1	Pandas and koalas eat almost one food exclusively while pythons will just about anything to get nutrition.
-1	China and Australia have two different cultures, but China's Panda and Australia's koala bear are both specialist. They both eat one or two foods while a python is a generalist meaning it'll eat mostly anything.
1	I would frustred to know where is being tested another word the specif materials which we are taking samples of in addition i would need to know the type of vinegar being since different vinegar have different ph along with the amount of vinegar added to each container these three pieces of information are all reason to replicate the experiment.
1	Based on the students data, the plastic type A of trial 1 was stretched less than the plastic type B of trial 1, from A 10mm and B 22mm. Also the trials have different results of type A, from trial 1 plastic type A stretched. 10mm and trial 2 plastic type A stretched 12mm. The student could have improved the experiment design by adding more trial and measure the amount of weight.
1	Additional information I would need to replicate this experiment would be the actual names of the samples. In step 2 I would need the exact amount of vinegar to pour into each container. Also in step 4 I would need the amount of distilled water to rinse it off with and for how long.
1	In order to perform the experiment the way the students did one thing you would need to know is how much vinegar to put in the container. Also what size container should be used. Another thing that should be known is what temperature should the samples kept at. Lastly what temperature should the water use to rinse off the samples be and how long should they be rinsed.
-1	I would need to know if they were put into an incubator to dry or were dryed in a different way. Would also need to know the temperature of the area incubator they were put into to dry. Also I would need to know where I should place a sample. Lastly, I would need to know the type of vinegar used c for example white, apple material. Also I would need to know how top measure the mass.
-1	A) The data shows that trial two was more efficient than trial one because they all increase other than one (plastic type). I can also conclude that the plastic type that stretched the most was plastic B. ^p B) Two ways the students could have improved there experiments are, 1. let it hang for longer than five minutes, and 2. perform more trials.
-1	Pandas and koalas are the same because they're both specialists. Each of them eats almost nothing but bamboo or eucalyptus leaves, which is also what makes them specialists, as stated in paragraph 21.
-1	From the story it says. China's panda eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's Koala bear, which eats eucalyptus leaves exclusively. These two animals are different from pythons because they eat leaves all the time and pythons only eat meat. Pythons can not adapt to any environment because of the climate and how they eat. A panda and Koala can because they only eat leaves.
-1	The China's panda and the Australia's koala are both specialist because they eat the same most of the time. Pythons are generalist which can eat diffent types of animals.
-1	One piece of information I would want to know is how big each piece of rock, plastics wood.
-1	You would need to know how much vingar is need and what is the purpose of the experiment.
-1	A conclusion for this experiment could be type T2 had been the strongest for the 1st two trials and then type T1 started lasting longer and in the end they stayed the same. Still showing that type T2 was the best choice. It showed that in the end type B was the strongest. The students could have improved their experiment by naming the types of bags brand they were testing  and they also could have clamped the bag a different way for example taping it to both sides and putting weights.
-1	I would needed to know what different samples to find the mass, how much starting mass I would need, and how to measure the ending mass. Without these three pieces of information, I would not be able to replicate the experiment exactly.
-1	The group needs to add what to label because
-1	Want wise the shops, if they wayed with the that they was holdings the thing, if it was dry, how much rinser did put in it.
-1	After you remove the containers, you rinse them & see what results you get in about so minutes.
1	a. Based on the data on the table, I can conclude that plastic B was the stretchiest followed by plastic D, C, then A. His results also seem precise because he did two trials and they were totally close to each other every time.  ^p b.  In the procedure, the student should have made each plastic sample the same size keeping it a constant variable. They also should explained how much weight to put on the clamps as it was omitted in the procedure.
-1	Some information that is missing that they don't say what size of containers, and they don't say what to do with data.
-1	"Pandas in China and Koalas in Australia are similar because they are both specialists species. Both only have one exclusively food source, panda ""eat almost nothing but bamboo,"" and the Koala ""eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively."" However pythons are generalists because they adapt and eat almost anything and can live almost anywhere."
-1	Where do you place the vinegar and where does the marble go in the experiment . Why do you need vinegar? Where does the acid come from?
-1	"Pandas in china and koalas in Australia are very similar. First these species would be described as specialists. Which only eat specific food. China's panda ""eats almost nothing but bamboo..."" while Australia's koala bear eats Eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. ""They are different than pythons because they can't live in different climates."
-1	I don't know what replicate means, so I don't know how to anser this question
-1	In the second trial, plastic A the stretch increased by two bara, Plastic B the second trial increased by one mm: almost it decreased one mm now in plastic D the stretch stayed the same. Two ways student could have improved their lab or validity, one was to have a third trial so you could see if there would have been a great change or to see which results were closer to results one and two to make your final choice. Another way to improve the lab was to try different measurements of plastic.
1	a) Plastic B has the most stretchability. If you take the average of the two trials plastic B, 22.5 mm, is higher then plastic A, 11mm, plastic C, 13.5mm, and plastic D, 10mm. ^p b) One way the students could have improved the experiment is by giving a specific amount of weight to add to each clamp. Another improvement would be to do third trial because this could increase the validity.
-1	T1 and T2 are very close with their data. They could've increased the time to hang the plastics to ten minutes instead of five. They could have named the plastics.
-1	a) Based on the data, plastic type B had the most stretchability followed by type A,C, and lastly type A. ^P b) One way the students could have improved their experiment design would be to identify a set mass of the weights. The students also identify a certain amount of type to have the same resistanes.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to Koalas in Australia because they are both specialists. They both require certain foods found in their specific area that is hard to find in other places. These two furry animals differ from pythons, not only in appearance. Pythons are generalist, meaning they van pretty much survive anywhere where there is a warm climate and they do not need one specific food to survive like specialist do.
-1	Pandas and koalas are both examples of specialists. They require a specific lifestyle, such as a diet or environment. Specialists favor stability. On the other hand a python is a generalist who can adapt to different conditions.They don't mind changes as much as a panda or koala would. Also pythons are considered to be an ''invasive'' species by some.
-1	Panda's are similar to Koala's by they are both specialist species. They only survive in certain conditions. They are not able to adapt very well and can only eat and live in certain climates. They are both different form pythons by they are not reptiles. Also a python is a generalist specie and can easily adapt to change. They eat a variety of foods, and accept change.
1	Cells use passive transport to help substances move across the cell membrane. The substances are going through diffusion and following their concentration gradient.Cells use active transport, also. During active transport, energy input is needed from ATP to move a substance against its concentration gradient.Cells use endocytosis and exocytosis to move things into and out of the cell. In exocytosis, vesicles fuse with the cell membrane and release their contents outside of the cell. In endocytosis, the cytoplasm moves inward and forms a vesicle around the incoming material.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because in the article it says they are both specialist animals and only eat one exclusive food. They are different from pythons because a python is a generalist animal and they do better around humans.
-1	Pour vinegar in each of four peparate but identical, containers. After 24 hours, remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water. Allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes.
-1	In order to replicate the experiment is to have more samples, time and containers. So you can use different sample different results of the mass in all objects.
-1	This is a clear investigation of the Acid rain , they clear show a good procedure on the sample and the starting mass and the ending mass and the differece in mass.
-1	Pandas and koalas are both specialists. As the article discribe a specialist thrive of stability and are picky. However a python is a generalist, not so dependent an thriving of changes.
-1	In conclusion, if the student was to go on with the investigation, T2 will allways have depending on the plastic 12, 23, 13, 20 up the numbers. ^p Two ways the students could have improved the experimtal are, 1) The could of told us how much weights to and 2) If they hang the clamp for 10min the experiment might have change.
-1	I believe that in order to replicate we would need the design of the experiment and when we
-1	(A) Trial 2 was the one with the most stretchability. Trial 1 was around the trial 2's numbers but trial 2 was a ting but tiger or stayed the same. Plastic C actilly decreased one. ^p (B) They should have tryedengce plastic more trials to see it most would increase or decrease.
1	In order for the me to replicate their procedure, I would need to know what four samples they used, they should include that in their procedure. Also they should stay  where you are to put the four containers during the 24 hour time period finally, they should include what type of vinegar or what brand so that when i were to do this experiment, I would in as close to what they actually did, and therefore would be able to replicate the experiment.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas because they eat nothing but plants for food. they are different from pythons because pythons are really dangerous and they eat other animals which can cause extintion.
-1	China's panda and Australia's koala are two animals that arent predator, pandas eat bamboo and koala's eat eucalyptus leaves. Therefore, they are harmless. They are both different from pythons because pythons are potentialy dangerous considering they can swallow an entire alligator you could conceivably have pythons shacking upto the Potomac
-1	Pandas and koalas are similar because they both only eat one type of plant. Bamboo for pandas and eucalyptus leaves for koalas. They are both different from pythons because pythons have a variety of food where ever they go while pandas and koalas can only only live in certain areas that grow these plants.
-1	A) Plastic type B stretched the most after five minutes stretching 22mm in trial 1 and 23mm in trial 2. The plastic type that stretched the least was type A. It stretched 10mm in trial 1 and 12mm in trial 2. In conclusion the strongest polymer is type B. ^P B) The first way the student could improve on the experiment in a whole is tell what type of plastics were each. He also could tell how much weight was added during the trials.
1	Based on the students data I conclude that plastic type B has the greatest ability to stretch. The students could have improved their design by specifying the mass of the weights attached so the experiment can be repeated, and they could have done more trials, so they could have more confidence in their results.
-1	Pandas and koalas are similar because they eat bamboo bamboos (panda) and eucalyptus leaves (koala). They are both different from pythons because they are not vicious and attacking creatures. They are gentle, whereas a python is vicious and fierce-looking, always ready to attack. A python can even eat an alligator.
-1	The conclusion based on the student's data is that plastic type B did the best out of all of the other plastic types in both trial 1 and 2. Also, two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and validity of the experiment again and to use more plastic types.
-1	To replicate this experiment, i would need to know what types of mative i used as so i would need a scope to wighe the motivel befor they get trement and after to make the steps easy they could have said repet steps 2 & 3 for each diffrent motivel used.
1	(a) Based on the student's data, you can conclude that plastic type B is the most stretchable and plastic type A has the least stretchability. ^p (b) One way the student could improve is by making sure the plastic strips are all the same length+ hanging off the table from the same point. Another improvement would be to record the original length of each plastic strip. This would provide a constant to compare the results to.
1	You would need to know the amount of vinigar they added, what kind of containers, and how much or how big each object is.
-1	The author says that koalas from Australia and pandas from China are both examples of specialists because they are basically native to one area and eat a certain diet. Both animals are different from pythons because a python is an example of a generalist. Pythons can almost live anywhere, a generalist species is very abundant and rather harmful, which is how they differ from pandas and koalas.
-1	In addition to this experiment the group should include what they would use to find the mass of these rock samples.
-1	Panda's and koalas are very similar because they eat every kind of animal. The only thing the panda doesn't eat is bamboo the story says. The pythons just roams around in bushes, cars anywhere but it can't take the cold. It ate a alligator one time and blew up.
-1	"Pandas in China and Koalas in Australia are different because they eat different foods. The article says ""China's panda, which eats almost nothing but bamboo or Australia's Koala bear, which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively."" A python can and will pretty much eat anything the article says a python swallowed on alligator."
-1	Trial D has better performed better.
-1	The plastic type A is shown to be the the strongest plastic type. Mean while the plastic type B shows to be the plastic that stretched out the longest.
-1	Pandas in china are similar to koalas in Australia because the both stick to one source to eat pandas which eats bamboo and koalas which eats eucalyptus leaves.They are different from pythons because as MacInnes the reptile pet rate doubled in a decade. But pandas and koalas are wildlife animals and can't be turned into pets.
1	You would need to know how much vinegar was placed in the container. What type of samples you were measuring and placing in the container and the temperature at which they were storing at to ensure equal experiment.
1	They need to state how much vinegar to pour in each container, what kind of samples to use and how much testing needs to be done after 24 hours.

Also I would need to know the control of the experiment so I could see what changed and how. I also need to know what I should use to measure the mass. They only say nreeus the mass in their experiment, they never told me specifically what to measure it with.
