1	In able to replicate this procedure 3 steps must be added: ^p 1) What are the samples. ^p 2) How much vinegar is poured into the 4 containers. ^p 3) What unit of measurement is used to measure it mass. ^p 4) What kind of containers were used.
1	Determine what the different samples are, then state how much vinegar you would be adding to each sample. State how long you are rising the materials in water. (ex 5 minutes)
-1	Panda's and koalas are the same because they both eat the same thing everyday all day. Panda's eat bambo and koala eat eucalyptus leaves. As the article states a generalist is like a raccon they can live anywhere from Florida to Antarctica, pandas and koalas can't because they rely on a surtan food sorse to live.
-1	The steps that this procedure is missing would be to list & gather all materials, because you need to know what you are working with, 2nd, say how much vinegar to pour into the containers the other part that this procedure is misssing is how much distilled water do you rinse each sample with. If you don't have this information, it would make the experiment very off with validity's. The containers wouldn't be the same.
-1	A panda is similar to a koala bear because neither one of them is harmful. They both only eat plants, and they don't really bother humans, so they're not a threat. They differ from pythons because pythons are harmful and they will attack humans.
-1	In order to replicate experiment I would need to know exactly how much vinegar to pour in each container, how much of each sample to put in the container, and
1	Some additional information that I would need to replicate this experiment would would be amount of vinegar, size of the containers, and the temperature.
-1	Pandas and koalas are similar in how they eat panda eat almost nothing but bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. Pythons are different because they will eat almost anything to stay alive. They are informing for endangered species in the Florida bays.
-1	Pandas and koala's are both specialist species. They only eat one type of food. Bamboo for the panda, and eucalyptus leaves for the koala. A python is a generalist species. It can live anywhere and eat just about anything. Pandas and koalas can only live in their natural habitats.
-1	Some additional information that would be needed to replicate the Acid Rain experiment may include the exact amount of vinegar that is poured into the containers. Also you should know the room temperature and to make sure the room keeps in steady temperature throught the experiment. Lastly, in order to replicate this experiment I would need to know how much distilled water to use and how should I dry it.
-1	Pandas and koalas are similar because they only stay in one places and they eat plants. Also they are specialists, while pythons are generalists. So the pythons eat meat and moves around different areas of the world.
-1	A) The data from this investigation shows that the plastic stretched the furthest was type B Next was type D, then type C, and finally type A. The information shows they did two trails to make sure they have correct information.^p B) One way the student could have improved this experiment design was to make steps and to explain the procedure more. Next, I would say to make a graph would be the best way to further improve these results.
1	In order to replicate this experiment i would have to know a few more things. One thing i need to know is the temperature at which they did the experiment. I would also need to know how much vinegar was used in the containers. Lastly, i would need to know the appropriate time for rinsing the samples.
-1	A. Plastic A is stretched the bigest throughout the experiment while plastic D shoved no change B. ^p The student could have improved the validity by adding more traits because the plastic. would have stretched larger if there were more trials and also add constants because if more things are the same throughout the experiment then the results would be more valid.
1	In conclusion to the polymer investigation lab, it is clearly known that plastic type B was the most stretchable while plastic type A was the least, according to the data collected. To improve the experiment the lab testers should have made sure that the plastic were all at the same length at the stare and recorded it. Also, they should've made sure they used the same weights.
-1	Both the panda and the koala are specialists, they can only live off 1 thing, or are dependent on something. An animal such as a python which is a specialist, is able to thrive in different environments.
-1	Pandas and koalas are specialists as they only eat bamboo and eucalyptus respectively. They are both very  adorable compared to the pythons. Pythons are generalists, as they can adapt to most environments. They can find food almost anywhere they inhabit.
1	I would need to know how much vinegar to put in each cup. I would also need to know if the samples had to be anything in paticular. Do you have to have the four samples related to each other or can they be random items? How long do I rinse the sample in distilled water for?
-1	Information I would need: ^p - what do they want to find out in other words, their implied aim. ^p - the amnt of vinegar. ^p - the amnt of sample.
-1	What was the purpose for them doing this experiment? ^p Why did they choose to set up there lable this way? ^p And for me to replicate the procedure would be impossible due to the fact that there's no problem also there not alot of information provide that examples the directions.
1	Additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is, in the procedure it needs to be more specific and staff what kinds of samples you are using ( marble, limestone, wood, plastic) Also, it needs to say how much vinegar to pour into each cup, and what kind of cup to use. Also, how long you should rinse each of the samples with the distilled water and lastly, be more specific on how to dry the samples, should you dry it with papertowel and then let it sit for 30 minutes, or just let it sit?
-1	In order to replicate the experiment you would need the amount of vinegar you use, for amount of marble,limestone and wood ,water you could use and has to determine the mass of the material.
1	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know what kind of samples to use. One would also have to know how much vinegar is being put in each container. Also, the students should specify what kind of container they are using in order to most closely replicate this.
-1	Pandas and koalas only have one type of food they can eat. While the python will eat almost anything, which means it can survive almost any where unlike the panda that need bamboo to eat or koalas which need eucalyptus leaves. These foods don't grow every where.
1	(A) The plastic that stretched was B T2 and the least was A T1. ^p (B) The way the student could of improved this expiremen is by when they put tape on top of the edge of the plastic sample to a table well they should of left putting weight on th plastic to see how much it holds.
-1	Pandas from China are similar to koalas in Australia because they have a very limited diet that for pandas is bamboo and eucalyptus leaves for koala bears, and they are both endangered because pythons have a larger variety in food so survival is easier for them.
-1	Pandas and koalas are alike because they are specialist which means they need to live in a certain area. Unlike the koala/panda, the python which is a generalist, can live anywhere.
-1	In conclusion, based on the students data collected, plastic type B was the farthest stretched. One way to improve the validity of their design to have different sizes of the plastic samples used. Another way to increase the validity is to get wide range of the different types of plastics.
-1	My conclusion is that plastic type is going to be more long because it look as if the student added more weight to it. The student could have improve this assignment by stating spicifically how much weight to add to the clamp, also this experiment could of been more successful if the student had different type of plastic sample to measure.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they eat nothing but eucalyptus and bamboo which is basically the same thing there both from trees. Pandas and koalas are different from pythons because pythons are endangered species and they're very large, they eat alligators. Big things when pandas & koalas only eat simple leaves. Things that are absud of tree bamboo.
-1	In order to keep this experiment valid you would have to make sure when they are to over night that they should all be in the same exact conditions.
-1	The information that you will need for the experiment is the results of the whole information following the dependent varable and indepennet varable.
-1	Make sure to include at least three pieces of information. Samples have lost in for mation because, iget information. Sample allow the samples to fit and dry for 30 minutes. ^p  Because, determine the mass of each sample.
-1	In order to appropiately replicate this experiment you would have to record and compare the results of the difference in mass in all four or if different substances. Also in this experiment, you would have to add to the procedure the temperature of which the substances will be present in making sure they are all the same. Also one piece that have to be added to this procedure is the amount of time the scteanst would take to rinse the objects with distilled water. Also in this experiment, it should be retained the total amount of vinegar that is placed into the identical cups and then should be removed after the substance is taken out.
-1	In order to replicate this experiment, the mass of 4 different samples should be held constant there should be a control group. The experiment should include how many times the containers were rinsed, and if it was rinsed with cold, hot or warm water it should also include where the samples were kept and the temperature, they were kept at. Also what was the group  investigating in should be included.
-1	a: Plastic type B had the most stretchability. ^p To improve the valedity of the results the students could have measured the plastic 2 times on each trial.
-1	"Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because their diets is plants, while pythons diet is meat. In paragraph 21, it says ""China's panda which eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's koala bear, which eats eucalptus leaves..."""
1	Based on the data collected by the experiment, plastic type B has the greatest stretchability when attatched to weights. However, there are ways in which this experiment could be improved. The student did not specify how much weight or how many weights were added to the clamp. He/she should write how many weights they used or even add trials where they utilize different amounts. Also, a third trial should have been conducted to formulate an average stretchability length. Only 2 measurements is not clear, a third would allow the student to achieve an average length for each plastic, making the numbers more simple to process.
1	In the students procedure, you would need to include the step for measuring out an exact amount of vinegar and adding that specific amount to the containers and they would need to include the amount of distilled water to rinse with in order to increase the validity. Also, they should specify what type of container to put each sample in, such as a test tube or a beaker. The students should specify what samples to use in step 1 as well, so that when replicated the same samples will be used.
1	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know what the samples were. In this group's procedure, they do not state what
-1	In order to replicate this experiment I would need a scare in order to get the mass. Next, I would need tape and markers to label the containers. Last, I would need all 4 samples and graduated cylinders as a container to replicate this experiment.
-1	Based on the result of the experiments we can conclude that plastic type B has the greatest elasticity of the four plastics. One way the students could have improved on their experiments is to run a third test. Adding another test should show they would get result similar too the first two tests.
-1	My conclusion is that they did a pretty good job setting up the data table. They not only tried it once they tried it twice. One way they could of done a better job by instead of the data table they shouldn't did a bar graph.
-1	You would need the name of the four samples you are using to make a table to record data. Write down you need to record the starting mass, ending mass and difference in mass.
1	According to the data given, plastic type B had more stretchability than plastic type A. However, the students should have stated the four types of plastics they used. Also, they should have kept the measure of plastic samples consistant.
-1	a. This base on the types of bag. ^p b. We could use anothe plastic type and will try the amount of stretching.
-1	a. Based on the student's data, the amount of stretchability in each opastic type was different for trial 1 and 2. (with an exception of type D that remained the same). ^p b. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design are to clarify the weight of the weight they added on step 4, then for step 6 they should have had clarified the procedure that had to be repeated (ex repeat steps 1-5 exactly for other three plastic plastic samples).
-1	To successfully replicate this experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar to put into each container because the results might come out differently with different measurements of materials. I would also need to know the amount of each sample to place in the vinegar. The final piece of information I would need to know is how much distilled water I am allowed to use to wash the vinegar off of the samples.
1	A) Based on the student's data, I can draw the conclusion that plastic type A is the most duriable because it stretched the least (an average of 11mm), while plastic type D is the least duriable. ^P B) To improve this experiment, the student's could have added a control and specified how much weight should be added to the clamp.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both eat some of natures resources. They are both different from pythons because pythons eat insects and animals. Although, pandas and koalas are found high above, where as a python is low on the ground.
-1	A conclusion based on the student's data would be that the plastics were other a little more or less stretchy the second time due to it being stretched out the first time. One way the student could have improved the experiment design was by performing a third trial without weights. Another way would be to allow them to hand for about 10 minutes the 3rd time.
-1	Pandas in China and Koalas in Australia are similar because they're both specialists species, not able to have anything else because of they're staple food source. Pandas mainly eat bamboo, while koalas mainly eat eucalyptus leaves. Both of these animals differ from a python because a python can live about anywhere it can find food and is a generalist species.
1	In order to replicate the experiment, they should say what temperature to keep the room at, they should also say exactly how much vinegar to put in each container because that would change the results. And also they should include a specific amount of how much of the sample to put in, because if one sample is bigger than another, that will also change the results.
-1	A. Based on this student's data, I conclude that trial 2 was more effective.^p B. One way the student could have improved the experimental design is give the names of the plastics they used.
-1	The independent varriable is the imarble, limestone wood, plastic.The marble starting point was 9.8g. The limestone was 10.4g and wood starting point 11.2.The end of the exeperiment is that you have to determine the mass of each sample.
-1	To draw a conclusion I would figure out the patium to this data table. B Two way I think the students could of improved on this data table would be to take step eight & make sure they're right.
1	After mRNA leaves the nucleus, it meets up with a RNA polymerase which begins to read the sequence at a start codon. As it reads the mRNA codons and tRNA begin bringing amino acids as they are called for by the mRNA. These amino acids are then joined together in the sequence ordered by the mRNA. Once it reaches the stop codon, it stops and the new protein made of all te amino acids is taken away.
-1	The additional information that would be needed is a control which could be no water added, 3 or more trials to make sure that their data is valid and also how much vinegar and water was used in the experiment.
1	To replicate this  experiment you would also need to know vinergar they used, the size of the cup and the the size of the samples.
-1	The students can include the measurements of the vinegar that is poured into the cups. How much of the material they will to put into the containers. Use the same amount of mass for each object.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both from the same specie. They are different because China's panda, eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's koala bear, eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. Pythons are generalist a raccon, a cockroach.
-1	In order for me to replicate this group's procedure, I would need to have the problem their hypothesis. Also the independent and dependent variables.
-1	A). The conclusion would be, that the procedure of this students data had went as planned. All of the results all were around the same number and some were the same. ^p B) Two ways the student could have improved on this experiment is to have a control group and also they could of had a third trial to make sure that the results were all correct.
1	After mRNA leaves the nucleus, the mRNA conects to a ribosome to produce the protien the mRNA codes for.  In the ribosome the mRNA is read in the sequence of codons and calls the tRNA to go out into the cytoplasm to get the correct amino acid that is called for in the codon.  The tRNA keeps bringing the needed amino acids which results to the making of a protien chain.  When the protien chain is complete it goes out into the cytoplasm and goes where ever it is needed in the cell or outside of the cell.
1	I would need to know the certain type of 4 samples I would need to use to complete the experiment. I would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each container so I would have unreasonable results. I would also need to know what type of containers to use in order to complete this experiment, whether it it is big, medium or small. It would also help to show the problem so I would understand what I am trying to investigate.
-1	Panda's in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists, they rely on one specific thing to live which is their food. They need stability to live. pythons are different fro pandas and koala's because they are generalists, they rely on change to survive.
1	"a) Out of all 4 plastics type B was the most stretchable for both trials, D was the second most stretchable, C the third, and A was the least"", To improve the experimental design, the student should have specified the length of the plastics and made sure they were all the same continuity and accuracy of the results. Another thing that should have been done is the mass of the weights should have been included and it should have been specified that they were all the same to again ensure accurate results."
-1	First the students should have the amount of vinegar that goes into each container. Also the group should use a control in this experiment. To replicate this experiment we will also need to know under what coniditions the samples an the vinegar woll be in. We would noed to know whether or not it was in the sun or dark because that will make a difference.
-1	"Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they only live in one place in the world and thy only eat one thing. Pythons however can live anywhere and can eat anything thy want to eat. ""A python swallowed an alligator and-theres not a delicate way to put it-exploded"" pg 5 says alot about pythons."
-1	Pandas in china are similar to koalas in Australia because they both eat only one food. They both are different from pythons because pandas and koalas don't eat meat, but pythons do.
1	Based on the students data after putting the weights over clamps the amount of stretchability decreased and the difference the between the trials went down one by one. Students could of improved the experimental design by weighing the weights and calculating how much preasure would be on the clamps. They also could of said the specific plastic samples they were using.
-1	Additional information you need in order to replicate this experiment is a control group. A control grap  should have no effect on the sample and is needed so you can base your answers off reliable sources. Also in order to replicate this experiment we need to know the amount of vinegar we are putting on the sample. We also would need to know.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both feed off of natural plants, for example pandas consumes only bamboo while koalas eats almost only eucalyptus leaves. However, they are both different from pythons because pythons are able to consumes any type of creatures including alligators and other non- invasive species.
1	After mRNA leaves the nuclues, it goes to ribosomal RNA. Each tRNA anticodon is attached to an amino acid found in the cytoplasm and comes to the rRNA. The tRNA forms the complement of the mRNA strand, and the attached amino acids connect to one another until a STOP codon is reached.
1	Plastic
1	A. In conclusion the plastic that stretched the most was plastic type B at 22 and 23mm. The plastic that stretched the least was plastic type A at 10 and 12mm. ^p B. One way to improve this experiment is to add constants like, how many weights and how much do they weigh. Also they should do another trial and then average out the results.
-1	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are both specialists; both species eat only a certain plant. The pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo and the koalas only eat eucalyptus leaves. Those two animals are different from pythons because pythons are generalists, which means that they can adapt to almost any also where as specialists cannot.
-1	a) Based on the results I can conclude that plastic types B and R had a similar stretchability because they increased by 1mm. Type C and D are not as stretchable because type actually decreased by 1mm after trial 2 and type D stayed the same. ^P b) The student should have told us much each weight and how many will go on the plastic types.
-1	In order to replicate this experiment I would need a hypothesis, the materials that are needed and the measurement of liquid I would need. I would do the experiment the same way so I would also need to know what kind of container to use. I would also need to know at what time the experiment started and ended.
-1	In the experiment  I would determine the mas of each sample pair the  vinegar into a container then label. I would wait 24 hours then pour out the vinegar and nose out with water. Let the samples dry and find the mass difference
-1	Both panda's and koala's are specialist. They mostly eat just one thing. Pandas eat bamboo, koala's eat eucalyptus. They stick to themselves unlike pythons. Python's food changes in variety. They mostly eat whatever they find. Pythons can live in different place but for the most part, panda's and koala's can't.
-1	First, in order to repeat the experiment I would have to know what's there investigation about and how much of the single sample are we suppost to bot in the container.
-1	There are three things you would need to know to replicate this experiment. You would need to know how much vinegar you needed to add to each of the four containers. Another thing you would need to know is if the four samples all needed to have the same initial weight or mass or size. Lastly the proceedure needs to tell you how to record your data. Also you need to know what they are comparing their data to their control and constants.
1	Based on the students data I can conclude that plastic type A was the strongest because it stretched the least amount. ^p b) For the student to improve the experimental design they could have written how much weight the put on the plastics. and to improve, the validity they should have done a third trial.
-1	"The students should include which is most resistant, least resistant, and how many drops of ""acid rain"" (vinegar) they put in."
-1	Pandas and koala bears are similar because they both seem to eat one thing only which is for example bamboo and for koalas eucalyptus leaves. Also they are both specialists. They are different from pythons because a python is a generalist and it can eat a variety of animals.
-1	"Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia by, they both are herbivores. Also, they both live in warm climates. They are different from pythons because one pandas and koalas are warm blooded and pythons are cold blooded. Also, pythons are located everywhere ""A USGS map showed potential pythons stretching from California to Delaware and including much in the south."
1	a)The strechiest polymer plastic tested was type B, followed by type C then type A being the least stretchiest^p b)The student could have. Improved the experiment by compieting more trials to make conclusion more valid. Also the student could use a constant measurement of how far off the table the plastic should hang and where to tape it the student could also improve it by using a set amount of weights.
1	A, In this experiment the plastic B stretched the most because it went 23mm and A went 12mm and 13mm and D 20mm. B. They could have improved there experiment by doing more trials, and have the plastics of the same lenghth.
-1	A) In conclusion, each A,B,C and D had different results. A and C stretched more. Both trial 1 and 2 had different answers accept plastic type D it reamred the same. ^p B) To improve this experiment students could of made more trials for more accurate answers. Also, repeat the steps.
-1	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia both has very low variety of food. Panda's eat only bamboo sticks & koala's only eucalyptus leaves. For pythons, panda's & koala's are compeletely different because in the article snakes are cold blooded and eats many different animals as oppose to pandas & koalas, they are warm blooded & eat one thing.
-1	After reading the groups procedure, to replicate this experiment I would need information such as the amount of vinegar used to  make  acid rain I would also need a control group as well as doing the experiment at least 2 more times to have more accurate conclusion.
-1	I believe that they should of put more information for example what happen when they were done with the experiment and what would happen if they didn't pour the right amount of vinegar that was needed.
-1	You will need to add in step 4 where to remove the samples. How to determine the mass of the samples. What materials to use for the sample. These were additional information needed in order to replicate the experiment.
-1	Pandas and koalas, eva fogh they live in different of the world are still very alike. The one thing they share the most is their food. They both only practicly eat one thing. For the panda its bamboo and the koala eats eucalyptus leaves both these two animals are very dfferent than a python that has no legs and eats anything.
-1	Pandas tend to eat nothing but bamboo. They relate to koalas in Australia because koalas eat one specific food exclusively as well, eucalyptus. Pandas and koalas are both different from pythons because they are more prone to survive in almost any climate, while pandas live specifically in China and koalas in Australia. Pythons are more abundant.
-1	I would need to no how much vinegar you would put into each cup, how they determined the mass and how much of each sample did they use in each individual cups.
-1	The information I would need in order to replicate the experiment is after you allow the samples to stand dry for 30 minutes does it have to dry in a cool area? What type of area it has to dry in and after it sits for 30 min what happens after you determine the mass?
-1	Pandas in China and Koalas in Australia are different from pythons because they need specific things to survive. The pandas eats almost nothing but bamboo and the Koala bear only eats eucalyptus leaves. This means that these animals are very exclusive. But a python can adapt almost where the climate is right. For example it can even adapt herein the U.S. The difference is that a python is a generalist and Koalas and Pandas are specialists.
1	For this experiments duplication, you would need to know exactly how much vinegar was used in each cup. You would also have to know how big in size each container was. Additionally, you would need to know the size of each sample, to assure that you could place them in the cups evenly.
-1	Pandas and koalas are similar to each other because they both only eat one type of food, while pythons try to eat anything that moves and fit in their mouth. This means that the koalas and pandas are much more likely to go about alike because of their food sources than the pythons.
1	In conclusion after doing this experiment I came to the conclusion that the plastic type by was the one with the longest length of the plastic types. It had 22mm in the first trial and it had 23mm in the second trial. ^p The student could've waited more than 5mins to measure the length.
1	A conclusion that can be drawn from the students data is that plastic B has the most stretchability. Two ways this student could have imposed the experimental design and or validity of the results is. The students could have said what the initial length of the plastic was and keep all the others plastics at the same length because if one plastic was longer than the other the experiment would be valid. And they also say how much the weights that were being used weighed because one could be heavier than the other.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because their both some type of bear. Although the koala and panda are different from pythons because pythons are generalist. With the assistance of technology they can live anywhere from Florida to Antarctica to outer space.
1	1. Selection- The membrane selects what is going and is coming out.
-1	The student's results show that plastic B was the most elastic. Plastic D was second. Plastic C was third and plastic A was fourth. In terms of stretchability plastic B is the most and A is the least. ^p Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and or validity is by doing more trials with different amounts of weight to really understand how stretchy the plastic is. Another way it could be changed is by changing the times of the trials to see how long it took each plastic to let the plastic get to the maximum length.
-1	If we streched 4 different types of plastics, then the second plastic (plastic D) would strech the farthest. ^p Two ways the students could improve the experimental design and for validity of the results are naming the plastics to know which one is which so the data will not get mixed up. Also doing more than 2 trials. Another trial might helped the data.
-1	I would need to know what the samples were.
-1	Based on the results shown, plastic B has the highest stretchability. After adding weight to the plastic for 5 minutes it showed that plastic B streched the most, 22 and 23 mm. Next in high stretchability comes D, C then A. Even though this experiment was good there are two ways to improve the experimental design. I think they should have tested how different weights effected each type of plastic. I also believe that there should be a controlled group, one with no weight to compare the results of adding the weights.
-1	Based on the students data plastic type A and B in trial 2 did better than trial 1, but C, D of trial did better than trial 2. One way the student could have improved the experimental design or validity of the results was to measure how can the table was that the weigh were hanging off the plastic with. Another way the could've done better was to test the trial again to see more results.
-1	Pandas are similar to koalas because they both are specialist species and they both eat very little. They also will become endangered as the earth continue to industrialize and expand.
-1	Numbe one, you need to know how much vinegar needs to go into the containers.
-1	Based on student data, I noticed that the trial two (T2) plastics stretched longer then most plastics in trial one (T1). I believe the students could have made the time period that they were stretched for longer. I believe some plastics could have stretched more. Also, I think that in their procedure, they should have discussed the amount of weights they put on the clamp for future reference.
1	We would need to know how much vinegar to use in each contaner, also what type of container shold be used and if we're usin pure vineger or if its a solution. Lastly it would be helpful to throw if the containers were left and at room temperature over the 24 hours.
-1	One thing they should do is explain why they are testing viniger. Also they should have a hypothisis.
-1	The reason the procedure is bad because they did not finish.
-1	Two ways that the student could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results, the first would be to figure out what kind of plastic and then write it down on the date table. The second way would be to write down the average of the T1 and T2. A conclusion based on the student's data is which plastic stretched the most.
1	Plastic B, proven by the results is the most stretchable of the four plastics. Due to it stretching 22mm on the first trial, and 23 mm on the second trial, its average amount stretched to 22.5 mm making it 25mm stretchier the the runner up plastic. ^p One way they could have improved the design of the experiment is by making sure all the plastics used had the same initial length. Also to tell how much the weights of the clamp weighed to be able to reconduct the experiment to do more trials.
-1	b) We need material they are plastic, tape clamp it shows that it was the lab of polymer plastics.^p Hypothesis if we attach a clamp to the bottom edge of the plastic sample then1 weights to the clamp and allow them to hang for five minutes and remove the weight measure the length of the plastic because repeat the procedure exactly for the remaining three plastics.
-1	In order to replicate this experiment, a control would need to be established. Also, a mass would need to be determined so that every material had the same mass at the beginning of the experiment. In order to accurately replicate this experiment, it would help to know if the containers were covered or uncovered for the 24 hours.
-1	"Like it said in the story, ""panda and koalas they eat certain types of food such as bamboo and eucalyptus leaves."" Pytons they can eat meat and even there own kind. So they can live pretty much anywhere."
-1	Chinas panda eats nothing but bamboo and as for koalas eat eucalyptusleaves
-1	Pandas are similar speals to koalas and they are both different to pythons becase pythons are not mammals and pandas and koalsas are herbivores pythons are carnivores.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas. Both of these species can only eat basically one thing, bamboo in a pandas case and eucalyptus in a koalas case. Both species are specialists and cannot adapt all too well unlike pythons which are generalists and can adapt easier.
1	"To replicate the ""Acid Baim Experiment"" the samples in step one should be identified to make the directions more clear. There should be a set and constant amount of vinegar, and the amount of time the samples are rinsed should be included. It should also say how to find the mass; whether to use water and a graduated cylinder, or a triple beam balance."
1	How much vinegar they aded into each container and how long do you rise each sample for, also the temperature the writer would be, Where the samples would be like in room temperature or in cold /hot areas.
1	a. Plastic type B was the strechiest plastic streching 22mm in T1 and 23mm in T2. Plastic type A was the least strechy and only streched 10mm for T2 and 12mm for T2. ^p (b) One way to improve the experiment would have been to add a trial 3 with a diffent set of weights. Second the experiments validity is off because there were no stated constants. The plastic starting length, weights added, and conditions like weather should be the same for all trials.
-1	China's pandas and Australia's koala both have specific food sources from specific places,pythons can live anywhere from Florida to Australia with the assistance of technology.
1	Some additional information I would need in order to replicate this experiment would be the amount of vinegar poured into each seperate containers. If I did not have the data table, I would also need to be told in the procedure what the four different samples are. It would also be helpful to know what type of containers were used. In order to replicate on experiement, the procedure must be precise and not have any information out, or else the data may come out completely different and not be comperable to the first set of data.
-1	In conclusion plastic type D based on our data stretched the most and plastic type A stretched the least. Type D stretched 20 for both trials while type a stretched10 for TI and 12 for T2. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design is to do another trial. Also to average the data out.
-1	If there is a control they would need to identify it, they should also tell the type of material, tell the mass' unit of measurement.
1	a)Plastic type B has the greatest stretchability, it stretched 22 and 23mm in both trials, while the other plastics stretched between 10 and 20 mm. ^p (b)The students could improve this experiment by adding more trials and by measuring mass of the weights.
-1	You would need to know first, the materials needed for the experiment. Then, if the materials are listed, it will be easier to use them later on in the procedure. Second, you will need to know how to measure the mass like with a triple beam balance. Also, you will need to know how to remove the samples from the container. Would it be necessary to  take it out it out with your hands or may be use a tissue or metal handler to remove samples.
1	In order to replicate this as the groups procedure would need to include what the four items they are testing and the group would also need to include the volume of vinegar which the four samples were added to. One last thing that would need to be specified is the concertation of the vinegar. If when the experiment is replicated and a different concentration of vinegar is used different results mass occuree.
-1	"Both pandas and koalas are specialists. They need to live in a certain place to survive. A panda is a specialist because it ""eats almost nothing but bamboo"" so it has to live where bamboo grow. The same thing goes for koalas and eucalyptus. Pythons on the other hand are generalist because they can adapt to a variety of places and are able to move around."
-1	I think that they should have did the project more than once probably about two more times to see if there project was right and they also should have written out there conclusion as well as putting it on a graph.
-1	You need some pictures and a statement.
1	a) The students concluded that platic B was the most flexible, stretching up to 23mm on the second trial and 22mm on the first. b) The student could have improved this design and validity of his lab in two ways. First he could have done the experiment a third time to further confirm results. Second, the student could have been more descriptive in his procedure explaing how to add weight to the clamp and how much weight to actually add.
-1	Pandas and koalas are very similar to each other. For one, they are both specialists. The fact that they are specialists means they can only survive in a single, stable environment that can support them. They are both very different from python, because the python is a generalist, which means it could live just about anywhere.
-1	In order to do this procedure perfectly you will have to know what the supplies and materials are before you begin. In order to have a valid trial of data, I would have 3 experiments for the rest of the samples.
1	Based on the student's data, plastic type B was consistently the stretchiest of all the plastic types used in the experiment. One possible validity issue is the description of the weights added to the clamp in each trial. The procedure does not tell in how much weight must be applied and thus a person may apply uneven amounts of weight dipending on the trial and plastic. This would cause the experiment to have the uniformity of its data in the fact that the weight was not constant. Also, the student could have improved the experimental design by adding more trials to the experiment and in turn gaining more data to make the results more accurate.
-1	Well fro 1 they could have named the plastics. The second way is to name why they are doing it,and finally they could have measure it was before they started testing.
-1	Pandas and koalas Are similar because they are both bears and they both eat one main type of food like pandas eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves.
1	Osmosis, which is the diffusion of water through a semi-permiable membrane, is one process that a cell uses to move substances across the cell membrane.Cells also use facilitated diffusion. In facilitated diffusion, glucose molecules, which normally would not be allowed to cross the cell membrane, is moved across the cell membrane through protein pumps.Active transport is also used by cells to move substances across the cell membrane. In normal diffusion, water moves from high concentration to low concentration, but with active transport, the cell uses energy to move substances from low concentration to high concentration.
-1	"The China panda bear and the Australian Koala bear are both specialists. "" what  favors specialists is stability"" ( Achen bach). The panda bear and the  Koala bear are different from the pythons because the pythons is a generalists "" what favors generalists is change, "" ( Achanbach)"
-1	a) Plastic type A has the most stretchability than the other plastic types. ^p b) The students could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results if they had more trials and a better control.
-1	My conclusion is that type B is the most stretchy, based on the results. The student should have improved this by doing it in even trials even though. Other could be how, put there's experiment on the table. This would have improved the validity.
-1	A conclusion I can make based on the student's data is that plastic A can only stretch about 11 mm. Plastic B can strech about 22.5mm. Plastic C can strech about 13.5 mm and plastic D can only strech 20 mm. One way the experiment could have been improved is by skeeping the weight added through out the experiments the same. The second way to improve the experiment is for the plastic to be maesured in asmaller unit rather than mm.
-1	Pandas in China are like koalas in Australia. They are both specialist animals, as the article states, and unlike the pythons they will only eat one type of food.
-1	"Pandas in China are similar to koalas i Australia because, they both eat leaves. In the article says that ""China's panda which eats nothing but bamboo"" or ""Australia's koala bear which eats eucalyptus leaves leaves almost exclusively"" Pythons are very different from pandas and koalas because pythons eat animals and pandas and koalas eat leaves for example the python ""swallow a alligator."""
-1	After reading the procedure, I would need to know the materials the students are using. I would also need to know why they are doing the experiment, what is the purpose? what kind of containers are they using and how big are they?
-1	In the experiment, they wood is the one that shaped the same and the limestone, the one that went down the most. If the experiment was for an hour it would double.
1	Based on the students data, I can conclude that plastic Type B is the most stretchable and sturdy polymer just because it stretched more than any of other plastic types in both trials. Two ways the students could have improved The experimental design and/or validity of the results would be by including in the procedure, the size of the weights used and the names of the different plastics incase another student wanted to replicate this experiment. Also he/she could have told us the starting size of the sample plastic prior to it being stretched
1	Osmosis - Diffusion of water through the cell membrane.Active Transport - Cell uses activation energy to surround and engulf the object.Passive Transport - Cell uses no energy and lets the object pass through the cell membrane with a special protein.
1	In order to replace this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the container. I would also need to know what type of container. I would even like
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they only eat one thing. Panda eats bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively.
-1	Those pieces of information you need to replicate this experiment are from the samples in 24 hours. Pouring vinegar into four seperate but identical containers, and to allow the samples be dry, you also need to determine the mass of the samples first.
-1	a) In conclusion (T2) stretched alot more than (T1). They were trying to investigate witch kind of plastic stretched more. ^p b) Two ways the student could of improved their design, was explain clearly what they were doing, and why in their procedure. Also maybe they should of did a (T3) to realy test it because if it was different in (T1), and (T2) then they definitaly dont have a final answer.
-1	To replicate the experiment I would need to know how much vineger is being poured in. I would also need to know if the mass should be the same for all student samples. Lastly how much of the sample should be getting added to the container, weather or not all of it or half of it should be added.
1	A. Plastic type A is stronger than the rest. ^P B. There a set length and width for each piece of plastic instead of it being whatever it happens to be. A different size may mean a difference in durability and strength.
-1	Both the Chinese panda and Australia koala are similar because they are both specialists, which means they live off one main food source. The panda lives on a diet off bamboo, and the koala mainly consumes eucalyptus leaves. But these animals are different from the python because the python is a generalist, which has many food sources. The python will eat rodents, small animals, or even large animals.
-1	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia depend on mostly one type of food source. Pandas eat nothing but bamboo & the koalas mostly eat eucalyptus leaves. Therefore if they were to be placed somewhere else, in another area it would be hard for them to survive. Pythons on the other hand that are moved from their native area will try and consume any animal to survive, like the python in Everglades region that was found swallowing an alligator.
1	Based on the students data we can conclude that plastic B has the most stretchability compared to plastics AC, or D. In trial 1 plastic type B stretched 22mm and 23mm in trial 2. All of the other plastics stretched less than this amount. For example, plastic A only stretched 10 & 12mm for trials 1& 2. Ways this experiment can be improved can be do to even more trials inorder to varify results even greator. They also can specify the size of the plastic and keep it constant. The length of each plastic shows the same. If the plastics are of different sizes then the results could be affected. Also, the students could have also specified how much like weight is and used the same amount of weights for each one. If one plastic had 21 kg on it and another 31kg, then the one with 31kg may stretch farther not because it has more stretchability but because it was held by more weight. This is how they could improve.
1	a. Plastic B has the greatest ability to stretch because it stretched the most in T1 and T2. ^p b. One way to improve the experiment would be to specify how long each sample is at the beginning of each trial and have them all the same initial length ( i.e 20mm ). ^p another way to improve this experiment is to specify an exat weight to be clamped to each plastic sample ( i.e. 100 grams ).
1	The students need to include what the samples were. You can't do an experiment if you don't know what you're testing on. The students should also include the temp. that the containers were stored at for 24 hours. Lastly, they should include how much vinegar was poured into each container. They could've put the same amount or different amount. They could've put little or a lot.
1	Based on the students data, the plastic type B was the plastic with the most stretchability. The group could have improved their design by specifying how much weight weighed and kept it constant by having each weight the same. Also, they should have included before and after length in their design table.
-1	Two ways they could've improved there expirament, would be that they couldve let the weights hang on the plastic for a little but longer, and that they shouldve used different types of bags. The conclusion was that plastic type B stretched the most out of all the other bags.
1	a) Based on the data, they can conclude that plastic B stretched the most.^p b) They could have included the mass of the weights added. They also should have included the size of the plastic samples.
-1	I think they should of kept the time the same because on this chart the times are differnt then the original time. So deffentally improve by keeping the time same.
1	First they should list the samples they used. Marble, limestone, wood and plastic in their procedure. They should also mention how much vinegar to pour on each sample to have the same effect. They should have also said to put their containers in same sort of cabinet, as a refrigerator, or somthing. Not just leaving it out of their processes.
1	They would need to include is a question of what they are trying to solve. Also they need to include what the four samples are in the procedure and how big they are. Another major thing they forgot to mention is what the climate of were the containers are sitting for the twenty four hours, are they all in the same spot as in dark or light. Thease are some key things that need to be included.
-1	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know what the samples experhar in the procedure are without this information I could use amthing as the samples that get completely difference showa.
1	a) Based on the students data one can conclude that plastic type B had the most stretchability. For both trials preformed, type B stretched the furthest at 22 mm + 23mm. Therefore, this type of plastic is probably the most durable of the  4 because it was able to withstand such stretching. ^p b) The students could have improved by specifying what types of plastics to use instead of just A, B, C or D. Also by specifying how far from the edge of the table each piece of plastic needs to be taped as this can effect results if they are not all the same lengths.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to Koalas in Australia because the both eat one thing exclusively. Pandas and Koalas are different from pythons because pythons eat alligators snakes could spread. There eating habbits are slightly different also. Snakes are cold blooded reptiles while Pandas and Koalas are warm blooded mammals.
-1	(A) The polymer experiment looks it went very well. Each plastics amount that was stretched was all around the same number for both trials. Two types of plastics increased after the first trial one type of stay the same amount, and one type of plastic decreased after the first trial. ^p (B) I don't think the student needs any thing to improve this experiment.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they adapt the same and they both eat mainly one meal. A panda eats bamboo, and th koala eats eucalyptus leaves. They're both different from pythons because pythons tend to eat various things such as rats, and in that one case, an alligator. The also move they habita and often.
-1	The plastic type B has the most elasticity over all the other plastics. Plastic type A has the least amount of stretchability over the plastics. A way he could've improved this experiment is by overaging out both times he measured the elasticity. Another way he could've improval this is by trying out more times and then averaging those out.
-1	One piece of information needed to replicate the experiment would be material starting because it could or from the. Another would be how many of each sample you are puting in the cup. And the last could be if there was a control to the experiment.
-1	I think they would need safety goggles and gloves to be safe. They could of extended the time. So, instead of being for 24 hours, it can be 48 hours for best results. I would actually give the samples 24 hours to dry because there is water inthe sample and it needs to evaporate.
-1	"Based on the student's data, I conclude that for the second trial, the plastic seem to have stretched slightly more than in the first trial. Also for plastic type ""D"" the plastic length stayed the same, meaning that it will not stretch any further. ^p b) Two different ways the students could have improved the experimental design is by adding more trials and more types of plastic to test."
-1	The conclusion that can be made from this students investigation is that plastic type B stretched the most. To improve the experimental design the students can give a better understanding on how to hold down the plastic and where to put the clamp. They should give more measurements for that so their results do not vary so much.
-1	Pandas in China & koalas in Australia are similar because eat plants like bamboo but a python eats other mammals. According to the article, a python once swallowed an alligator. Therefore, pandas & koalas are best to have around humans because a python is a major threat.
1	My conclusion to this experiment is that plastic sample B streched the most because it was probly a sample streches easily.^p B) Two things that could be changed is saying what kind of plastic it was and saying hope much weight is put on each clamp.
-1	"As stated in the article pandas and koalas mainly feed off of plants such as bamboo and eucalyptus leaves. Paragraph 21 ""which eats almost nothing but bamboo, or euclayptus leaves"". On the other hand a python eats whatever it can find such as rats and alligators. pg.5 ""A python swallowed an alligator."" Obviously pandas and koalas are peaceful animals unlike the phyton that exploded."
1	a) Based on the student's data, plastic type A is the least stretchable, while plastic type B is the most stretchable. Plastic types B and C fall in the middle of these two in terms of stretchability; B was more stretchable than C. ^p b) One way the student could have improved the experiment would be cutting all of the samples to uniform lengths and widths, rather than simply measuring what their length already was. The student also could have specified how much weight was being added to each sample.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both a specialist species and they are different from pythons because pythons are a generalist species.
-1	"Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both eat one type of food all the time. In the text it says ""A specialist is China's panda, which eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's koala bear, which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively"". They are both different from pythons because a phython will eat any thing it could eat. In the text it says ""A python swallowed an alligator and-there's not a delicate way to put it-exploded""."
-1	Some additional information you would need in order to replicate the expirement is to say how many containers and what size, how many containers and what size, how much of the sample to put in the container.
-1	"Pandas and koalas are both similar due to the fact that they both eat certain foods almost exclusively. In paragraph 21 it states that pandas eat ""almost nothing but bamboo,"" while koalas eat "" eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively"" These animals are both different to pythons as pythons are ""generalist"" and can eat nearly anything."
-1	As the article states, a python is considered to be a generalist having the power to live with technological assistance where as a panda, or Australia's koala are contrasted in the specialist category. They feed off of local plants and revolve a round them, making it difficult/ impossible to be abundant elsewhere like the python.
1	After reading the groups procedure, I would need to know some additional information to replicate the experiment. First, I would need to know what type of material is being used. Another thing I would need to know is where to keep the material; in sunlight? in darkness outside? I would also need to know how much vinegar to add to each cup.
1	Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are: diffusion, osmosis, and active transport.  Diffusion is when substances are moved from areas of a higher concentration to areas of a lower concentration. Osmosis is the movement of water through a selectively permeable membrane.  The water moves from a high concentration to a low concentration.  Active transport is the opposite of diffusion.  In active transport substances move from areas of a low concentration to areas of a high concentration.
1	Other information
-1	"Pandas and koalas are similar because they need special environment and food to live, while pythons don't. To show the relationship between these creatures Mac Innes explains, ""What favors generalists is change. What favors specialists is stability"". In other words, pandas and koalas need stability to thrive, while pythons doesn't."
-1	Pandas and koalas are similar because they both live in colder climates and need certain things to survive, pythons are different then pandas and koalas because they live in the warmness, and they're reptiles.
-1	To improve this experiment the student should have mentioned the 4 different types of plastic if mentioned, it would give a more accurate reason as why one type of plastic is more/less stretchable than the other. Also, what the different plastics are made off. If we know that it may help us know why that plastic is, or is not more stretchy from another type of plastic.
1	Plastic type B stretches the farthest. The students could have improved the experiment by doing a third trial and by specifying how much weight to add to the clamp.
-1	To replicate this experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar you are using to put in the four cups, what measuring tool you are using to measure the mass of the samples, and what yourdetermining the mass of. In their procedure, it doesn't say how much vinegar they used nor the measureing tool they used. It also doesn't provide us with the answer of what they are actually getting the mass of.
1	a) I conclude that plastic type B has the best stretchability and plastic type  A has the worst, type B had 23 and 22 while type D had 10 and 12 mm stretchest. ^p b) The students could improve their experiment if they recorded how many clamps they added before the plastic brake. The students also could have recorded the time the plastic brake at.
-1	You would need the amount of mass from start to last and you will need vinegar, distilled water and some other materials.
1	First piece of information I would add is the name of the different samples and how much vinigar was put in to the container when you started. Then when you finish how much vinigar was in the container.
1	Each plastic type had stretched about 1-2 millimeters, as where type D did not stretch much, therefore the type D plastic was the strongest.^p Two ways the students should have improved there experimental design would be not to use the same plastic each trial, do it three times instead of two, and include the length from floor to table.
-1	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar did they put in each sample so you can get the exact amount of ending mass, because if we put a different amount we're going to get a different result.
-1	I would write how much vinegar was put into each of the test tubes. Also I would repeat the experiment again to see if the information that I have is accurate and write why these is vinegar being added to each of the four samples.
1	A) A conclusion drawn from this experiment would be that plastic type B has the most flexibility. B) One way to improve the experiment would be to make sure each plastic gets weights in the same places. Another step would be to make sure the clamp was on the same place on each plastic so the experiment is more valid.
-1	The China's panda eats almost nothing but bamboo and the Astrailia koala bear eats eucalyptus almost exclusively.
-1	Panda's in China are similar to koalas in Australia  because both species rely on basically one source of nutrients. Pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo, and the koala bear eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. These two animals are different from pythons, because pythons have abundant sources of foods unlike the panda bear. Pythons can almost eat anything. A dramatic situation that happened in the Everglades in, 2005, was that a python swallowed an alligator.
1	A conclusion I can make is trial plastic type D is the most stretchable and type A is the least stretchable. The student could have improved the experiment by indicating and using a specific amount of weights that is unchanging between plastic types and trials. Also, the student could have indicated and used a certain length and width of each plastic that is the same for each trial and type of plastic.
-1	In order to replicate this experiment more information is needed. For example, there has to be clear statement of problem. This procedure doesn't explain why they were finding out the mass of four different samples. Also there has to be information  on how much vinegar they put in each container that way we can replicate the experiment.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to Koalas in Australia because they both only eat  one thing pandas eat only bamboo and Koalas only eat eucalyptus. They are different from pythons because they don't eat things other than plants.
-1	You would need to know the portions of what they used as not to ruin the experiment, or not usin enough or too much may not give you the same results.
-1	(a) Based on the data I can conclude that some of the plastics increase by 1 or decrease by 1. ^p (B) To improve the investigation the student should have added another trial to see how it improve.
-1	"Pandas and koalas are similar because both eat almost one food. ""...China's panda, which eats almost nothing than bamboo. Koalas bear... eats leavs."" They are both very different from pythons because of what they eat pythons eat a lot of them. ""A python swallowed an alligator..."" This shows how pythons eat almost an thing while panda and koalas won't."
-1	A) The plastic was stretched, but not a lot, at the most it was stretched two inches. ^p B) They could have said how heavy the weights were, also state what type or brand of plastic is being used.
-1	In conclusion, plastic D stretched more than all the other plastics two steady trials of 20mm each. Plastic type A & B both stretched a little more in trial 2 and plastic type C stretched less. Plastic type B stretched the most having stretched 22 then 23mm. ^p Improve:(1). Show in graph beggining length of plastic ^p (2) Create a T3 and try it once more. ^p (3) Add another 3 trials with different weight.
-1	Based on the experiment's data the plastics A through C stretched up & down. However plastic type D did not change at all in both trials. Plastic A's amount of stretching went up by 2. Plastic B's stretching amount went up by only one. Plastic type C also only went up by 1. The students could have improved the experiment by having more tests & having a control.
1	After reading this groups procedure, there are four different pieces of information I would need to replicate this exact experiment. One, the group must include what the 4 samples are, anyone reading this procedure would not know what the experiment was testing. Two, you must include the amount of vinegar being poured into each separate container. Thirdly, they must include under what conditions should the samples be left for the 24 hours. Lastly, I would need to know what types of containers these samples should be placed in, should they be put in plastic or glass or even open or closed containers?
-1	The additional information needed is the amount of vinegar put into the containers. They had only done the procedure once, to make it valid they had to do it 3 more times. They have to get the exact or the same containers to get a fair result. In the procedure it says (2) pour vinegar in each of 4 separate, but identical containers.
1	In order to replicate this group's experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each
-1	a) A conclusion that could be drawn on their data is that on the plastic types C for T1 pool more than T2 and for plastic tyre D T1 and T2 had the same amount of stretched (mm). ^p b) They could have tested their experement out longer and they could have used more interesting materials.
-1	The procedure should include what type of measurement to measure the 4 samples in, which would he grams as shown in the data table. Also what to measure them with. It should specify the amount of vinegar which needs to be poured into the containers. And finally, the procedure should explain how to determine the masses of the samples  in step 6
-1	The procedure did not tell the reader that they would have to record their data. This is important to replicate the experiment because if you do the experiment without writing anything down, you can't see the results as well.You would also need to know how much vinegar to put in the containers and have it be the same amount for each sample. You might also want to include the difference between the starting ending mass in the data findings.
-1	Pandas and koalas are specialist animals meaning basically they rely on their environment to survive. Both of these animals eat almost nothing but a one certain food they like. This is why they differ from pythons who can travel to different places and adapt to most environments to survive.
-1	To replicate the experiment there would need to be a control group which is what didn't receive the treatment and in this case didn't receive the vinegar, needs to be more clear. It says pour vinegar into a container but it's not specific as to how much vinegar. Also how much of the sample that will be used isn't stated.
-1	The plastic type D is stretched the same amount in both trials. One thing they could of improved on is they should have have 3 trials not just 2.
1	a) We can conclude that plastic B is the most stretchable from all the types, but the lab is not valid because judging by the results the lab was not done the same for each trial.^p b. Two way to improve this lab are: Have s or third trials at least, state the weight of the product used to put on the plastic materia.
-1	In this experiment you would need to know the purpose of this experiment in order to replicate it. The students chart shows the before and after results and the procedure is good, however, it does not state what the purpose is here. I think the purpose is to test permeability at the samples. You would also need to know what samples you could use.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists rather than generalists. They also eats from a very specific food source. They are different from pythons because the python can live anywhere in the world. In the article it talks about it living in many different areas but the koala and panda don't have the ability to live anywhere.
-1	(A) In contend the data recorded shows that plastic type D stretched the same amount in each trial. ^p (B) The students could have done a third trial they could have also had the weight and clamp hang for a longer time.
-1	One thing they should include is how much vinegars they need in each cup so you can measure be the same in all the containers.
1	I conclude that plastic type B stretched the most. One way the students could have improved the  experiment design and / or validity of the results is to make sure all the plastic types start out at the same length. Another way is to have a certain amount of weights for all the plastic type trials.
-1	It will be not that different from the other test that was done because if there went down or up a little. He could have done a bar graph for the things he was trying to figure out about it all or just had at least told the time he did it.
1	a) A conclusion about this data is that plastic type A+B stretched longer the second trial and that type C stretched longer the first and D stayed the same. You can also conclude that plastic B has greatest stretchability. B) Two ways [the students could have improved the experimental are sign is that they could have done more trials to increase validity. They also could have used the same length of different plastics each time.
-1	My conclusion is trials (T2) stretched better than (T2). The student could have used a different type of plastic and they could have just made the sample very larger.
-1	In order to replicate this experiment, the group would need to most importantly state what the experiment is for, name the materials used and a hypothesis for the experiment.
-1	A) My conclusion based on the student's data is that T2 A-B held a stronger than for T1; C for T1 was the one more mm than T2 but both trials seemed out for plastic type D. ^p B) Two ways those students could have improved is if they kept the plastic the same size and shape. And if they let hang for a min longer.
-1	"Pandas and koalas are similar because they need special environment and food to live, while pythons don't. To show the relationship between these creatures Mac Innes explains, ""What favors generalists is change. What favors specialists is stability"". In other words, pandas and koalas need stability to thrive, while pythons doesn't."
-1	To reeplicate the procudure,the additional information i would need include:Which samples of materials were placed first to last and basically in counts of even seconds, which materials were processed longer into the vinegar filled containers.
-1	Pandas and Koalas are specialist. They do not cope well with because they eat only one type of food. Pythons are generalists. They can adapt to many different areas of the world because they eat many different types of food.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because pandas eat almost nothing except bamboo and the koala bear eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. They are both different from pythons because a python will eat pretty much anything big or small, live or dead, as long as they have something to eat they're pleased, koalas and pandas don't have a wide variety of food like the python.
-1	In order to replicate this expirement they would have to
-1	Pandas in China and koalas from Australia are similar because they are specialists. The pandas only eat bamboo and koalas only eat eucalyptus leaves while a python can heat almost every thing humans can because they're generalist.
-1	I drew a conclusion based on the students data that plastic type B stretched out the most in mm for both trial one and trial turn. One way the students could have improved their experimental design is that they could've informed us what type of plastics were being tested like; garbage bag, freezer bag and sandwhich bag. Another way the students could've improved their experiments by how many weights did they put in for each plastic bag they stretched out.
-1	I would need to know why wood did not change?Why limestone it bigger and why plastic is small number
-1	The conclusion of this lab shows that in the first trial the plastic was stretched 2mm. Trial two it was stretched 1mm. Supprisingly in the third trial it actually got smaller by 1mm. Also the last trial it stayed the same length. Two improvements could have been how the students should have made the weights heavier and should have made a clearer data table.
1	a. Plastic type B has shown to be the most stretchable polymer plastic by stretching about 23 mm. ^p b. One way the student could have improved the experimental design is by doing more trials. Another way would be writting down how many weights they added to each plastic type.
-1	A. In conclusion, based on the student's data polymer plastic B stretch the most in both trials done & the least that stretch both trials was type A, leaving us to see B is the most stretchable from all for types. ^p B She could have included a time limit for the plastic to dangle freely. Second she could have made a graph to have it be more visual.
-1	They are similar because they are slowly becoming extinct, but they are diffrent from pythons because no one keeps koalas or pandas as pets.
-1	A.) Plastic type 2 had more stretchability then all the other plastics tested. ^p B>) The student could have improved the test by saying how much weights was added during the experiment. The student could have also discribed the rate at which to add the weights for consistancy.
-1	As we can come to a close the students in results were very close numbers when they did trial 1 and then trial 2, we can see that when they stretched both trials they got the same answers 20mm. This is what we can conclude about the data.
-1	The China panda and the koala are similar because they are both called specialists for eating only one thing. In the article, it says that the China panda is a specialists and it eats almost nothing but bamboo, and it also says that the koala eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. They both have that in common.
-1	The students should have made a hypothesis of what they thought was going to happen. Also they should have stated what they were investigating. They should have made a conclusion from the results.
-1	"Koalas and pandas both look the same and there small. A python slithers and cannot move as fast as a koala or panda. ""And there warm and fuzzy."""
-1	Tell us to do it again.
1	There is not enough data to draw a conclusion from the students data, the students never told us what the starting length of the polymer plastic where and they never told us how much the weight weighed.
-1	"pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they are becoming extinct this is different because pythons are becoming more popular because in paragraph 3 it says "" The pet increasing estimates that 4.8 million households now contain one or more reptiles, a number that nearly doubled in a decade."
1	The plastic that the most stretchability is plastic B, probably due to the fact that all of the polymer links are parallel to each other, and it stretched an average of 22-23mm. 2 ways that this could have been improved is having a 3rd trial, and using the same length for each sheet or plastic.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are their specialist. Pythons are generalists which are the complete offer, to pandas and koalas. The text states ''a generalist is a raccoon, a python, a cockroach, a white-tailed deer. A specialists is China's panda or Australia' koala.'' The specialists are the peaceful creatures that keep to themselves and generalists are the destructive creatures that are harmful and dangerous. This is just like a house cat compared to lion or a dog compared to wolf.
-1	Pandas from China are similar to koalas in Australia because they eat planets and their specialist. The pandas from China and koalas from Australia are different from pythons because pythons are generalist. Generalist are animals that can live anywhere but specialist have to stay in a warm habitat.
-1	1 Let the samples sit to dry for different amount of time. ^p 2 Try different containers, not identical , different size/shapes. ^p 3 Try more than  one type of acid, besides vinegar. ^p 4 Let samples sit larger than 24 hours.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists. While its possible to introduce a generalist into a new area (such as the pythons in the Everglades) as panada eat mainly bamboo, and koalas eat mainly eucalyptus leaves, they would not be able to survive. We've seen that the python can survive.
-1	Pandas & koala bears both eat plants while the snakes eat animals.
1	Some additional information I would need is, I would need to know how much vinegar t put into the containers. I would also need to know what the samples are. To replicate the experiment I would need to know where to put the container weather it be in the same room temperature or anywhere else.
1	a. Based on the student's result, it can be concluded that plastic B is the most stretchable because it stretched an average of 22.5 mm in 5 minutes. Plastic A is the least stretchable because it stretched only 11 mm in 5 minutes on average. ^p b. 1. The student should have specified the amount of weight added to the clamp and possibly performed more trials at different weights. 2. The student should have performed a third trial to obtain more consistent and dependable results.
-1	"Pandas in China can basically only live in China because they only really eat bamboo and can only survive in China. Koalas only eat eucalyptus leaves and can only survive in Australia where there are eucalyptus trees. Pythons can eat practically anything and live in a variety of different areas, "" A USGS map showed a potential python habitat nothing from calltah to deleware "" This shows that pythons can live almost anywhere."
1	Additional information that you would need for this experiment would be how much vinegar to put in, how big the container should be, and if the material should be or shouldn't be fully submerged by the vinegar.
-1	Based on the data, B was the most stretchable polymer, followed by D,C and lastly A. Serious sources of error need fixing. For one, the initial length of plastic was not held constant making all data most. Also, allowing the plastics to stretch until breaking. Would truly test this property. However, as the results are consistent between trials, the results seem valid.
-1	a) Plastic type a had the highest stretchability, while plastic type D had the lowest stretchability. ^P b) 1. Say the exact measure of the plastic sample (in step 1) to make them all the same so that the starting mm of the plastic would be a constant. ^P 2. Have a control group, one piece of plastic that did not have a clump on the bottom edge.
-1	Pandas in china are similar to koalas in Australia because they are specialist animals, pandas eats almost nothing but bamboo and koalas eat nothing but eucalyptus leaves. Pythons are generalists they are most abundant and they do best around humans. And their food can be found in a variety of places.
-1	A) In conclusion the amount strech T2 streched a little bit more than T1 by 2 mm. I shows that T2 can strech more than T1. ^P B). One way they can improve by waiting a little longer the five minutes and second way is that they should of used three kinds of different plastics.
-1	Two samples of each material must be collected make two charts, one for your first trial and one for the second. Calculate the averages from your two trials.
-1	To replicate this experiment you would need to add what scale weight rocks with. You will need a more detailed procedure with a lot of steps so what youcan know what you have to do.
-1	A) Based on the data given, in the second trial, the plastics stretched more than the first. Also, plastic type B and D stretched the most in both trials. ^p B)Two ways the student could have improved their experimental design would be more specific with the procedure and try more trials to average out the results.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because panda in china eats almost nothing but bamboo and Australia koala bear eat eucalyptus leaves. There different because they eat plants and pythons eat animals.
-1	One thing that they need to put in their was the amount of vinegar and what was the point of doing these.
1	I would need to know what were the four different samples. How much vinegar to pour into the four separate contains. Also what to label the containers and should I leave the container at room temperature or put it somewhere else for the whole 24 hours.
-1	Koalas always eat eucalyptus leaves and a panda always eat bamboo. They both are different from pythons because pythons are carnivores and pandas & koalas aren't.
-1	First off they dont tell you how much vinegar to put into the containers, & also that they should have addedacontrol or just water to have samples to confound and do.
1	To tell me what the samples are in the procedure. ^p How much vinegar to pour in the four containers. ^p Where and at what temperature are they putting them in.
-1	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are not like pythons at all. Pandas only eat bamboo and koalas only eat eucalyptus leaves. In the Everglades in 2005 a python swallowed an alligator and exploded. This shows that pythons will try to eat anything if their habitat is changed.
1	To repeat this lab I would need to know what kind of vinegar they used. How much vinegar they used and if the containers was covered or not.
1	Diffusion:  movement of materials from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration.Osmosis:  moving of water across the cell membrane from high concentration to low concentration.Sodium-Potassium pump:  movement of potassium ions across the cell membrane, being replaced by sodium ions.  (Results in the feeling of something (pain, heat, cold.))
-1	Plastic types B and D stretched significantly father than A and C. This allows us to infer they have weaker bonds making them more succeptible to stretching. One way the data would have been to write down the initial length of the plastic, also record the initial weight. This way we have more information to base our conclusion off of.
1	The group should be more specific including the names of the samples(Add rain sample1,2,etc.). They should specify what kind of container to pour the vinegar into in step 2. In step 4, they should say where to put the samples after they have been removed from the container.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they survive eating only one kind of plant, (bamboo for pandas, eucalyptus for koalas). While pythons can eat different kinds of animals and survive in different environments.
-1	What would need to replicate the experment is the mass of four diffrent samples, vingar, cotainers, and water.
1	a)- A conclusion would be that plastic type A could withstand the most weights with out being stretched the most. ^p The first thing they could do to improve their experiment would be to use a specific # of weights and clamps. The second thing would be to increase the number of trials.
-1	Pandas in china are similar to koalas in Australia because they both eat, but they eat different things .They both are different from pythons because they eat plants and bamboos and pythons don't. Also a python is a snake and they are bears or almost bears.
-1	Pandas in China are different from koalas in Australia because they live in different places as well as how their diets are different. they are both different from pythons because they are specialists and pythons are generalists.
-1	I would need to know what was happening to the samples during that 24 hrs. 2 I would need to know why they chose the four samples that they did. 3. I would also need gloves and a mask to protect myself.
-1	After reading this groups procedure some additional information they would need to add to complete this experiment is first, they need to tell you correct measurements such as how much vinegar to pour. Also, they should tell you how to determine the mass of each sample because there are many possible was you could find the temperature or measure it etc. Both of these observations should be added to the produre in order to do the experiment.
1	The weights and clamp and measure the length of the plastic.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both herbivores. They eat plants. The  panda and koala are different from pythons because pythons don't eat plants, they eat meat and other species.
1	In total we came a conclusion that plastic type B stretched the furthest in both trials I and II and plastic A stretch the least in trials I and II. ^p Two ways the student could have improved the experiment design and/ or results was by stating how many the weights were and did more trials.
-1	You would  need to have a control group in order to have the accurate masses of the samples. Also plase the same amount of vinegar  and water into each container, Allowing students to record the correct data.
-1	Pandas and koalas are the because they both real from the same family and they eat bamboo and the both are different from a python in many ways one the are reptiles and the pandas and koalas are not also snakes are spreading threw the United States these bears anr basically stay in China.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Austealila, because a China's panda eats almost nothing but bamboo, and Australia's koala bear which eats eucalyptus leaves according to the article. My opinion is their almost identical to each other.
-1	"Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they need to stay in one area to survive. In paragraph 21, it says ""A specialist is China's panda, which eats almost nothing but bamboo.."" (pg 5). A python, however, can travel to most places, not needing one specific environment."
-1	In order to replicate this experiment I would need four of the different mass samples and also pour vinegar in each of the four separate, but identical containers and place a single sample into a single container for 24 hours and after that remove it and let it dry for 30 min and determine the mass of each sample.
-1	One way it would have been good to improve the experiment is listing the steps or procedure properly.
-1	a) According to data table the plastics had verry little change from trial to trial for an example plastic type A for trial was 10mm and trial 2 was 12 so it stretched more the second time and for B trail 1 was 22 and trial 2 was 23. for C T1 was 14 and T2 was 13 but a changed happened on plastic C the measurement stand the same for both trials with amount of 20. B) Two ways the students had did different times for each trial. Also the clamp they should have put the plastic some where else cause maybe the clamp had added more weight.
-1	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they can only live in those areas because they only eat bamboo or eucalyptus. They are specialist. Pythons however are generalist because they can eat rats, bugs and other things so they can live in different places.
-1	To determine the mass of four different samples, to pour vinegar in four seperate container. Place a sample of one material into one container and label. After 24 hrs remove the samples from the containers, allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 min and finally determine the mass of each sample.
-1	Based on the student's data both plastics type A and B has increased in T2, type C has dicreased in T2 and type D stayed the same. ^p Two ways that the student could have improved the experimental design is add more control and make more trials.
-1	a) Plastic B was definitely the most stretchy and of all the plastics. ^p B) He could have recorded how much the plastic stretched at certain intervals of time, maybe every minute. he also could have tested both plastics each to back. The same way twice in 3 trials.
1	Additional information I would need to know would include several things. I would need to know what the four samples of material are. I would also need to know the amount of vinegar to pour in each container. I would lastly need to know what type or size my containers need to be.
-1	Panda in China are similar to koalas in Australia because of the food they eat. Bamboo for pandas and eucalyptus for koalas
-1	Chinese panda are similar to koalas in Australia be cause the both eat what nature has provided for tem such as bamboo and eucalyptus leaves. While on the other hand pythons prey on other animals, killing them.
-1	a) I can conclude from the results plastic type A stretched the most out of all the other plastic types. ^p b) They could of added more details to the procedure. For example to record all our data.
1	1.Diffusion- when cells go from a more concentrated area to a less concentrated area.2. Facilitated Diffusion- when molecules can't move through the lipid bilayer and move through the protein channel instead3. Osmosis- the diffusion of water through a selectively permeable membrane
-1	Pandas and Koalas are specialist species because they survive aft at a single food source, limiting there habitat to were that groups. Pythons on the other hand, are a generalist species and can survive in many different areas from many different food sources.
-1	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know the materials your using. This procedure does not state the materials needed so you have no idea what to put in the containers full of vinegar.
-1	Koala & panda are similar both are animals & are forms of bears and panda eat bamboo & koala eats eucalyptus which is almost exclusively. Their different from pythons because thier not reptiles & eat leaves and grown stuff instead of meat or flesh.
-1	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are different from pythons. Pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo and koalas eat exclusively eucalyptus leaves.
1	The procedure is missing a few initial details about the experiment. There should be a control of how much vinegar is placed into each cup and the percentage of the vinegar should also be same to each cup. The group should explain more on how the samples will be washed since if they washed them in a jer a sink pieces could chip off, decreasing the mass. The group also needs to be more specific on the containers being used: whether they have atop and if they all are the same color and size.
-1	You can conclude that plastic B was the most maluble and was able to stretch the most while plastic A was the most rigid and least stretchable. Two ways the experiment could have improved was to also test for longer amounts of time, to see if time was a factor. Using different wights for different trials could also give out more beneficial data.
-1	You would need to add materials that you need to use. You also would want to know how much vinegar you should pour in the cups. You should also say what you should label the container with if it should be the sample or letters like A, B, C, D.
1	(A) After finding all of the measurements and recording the data, I can see that plastic type B has the most stretchability. Then  plastic type S, then C and finally A, which has the least amount of stretchability.
1	Additional information that I need in order to replicate the experiment, is how much vinegar should be poured in the containers. And if it should be the same amount in all. More information needed is the amount time that the samples should be rinsed with distilled water. Lastly, information also needed is where to put the samples for the 24 hours. It doesn't say if the samples were put in different locations.
1	In order to replicate this experiment, one would need to know, first or all ,what each sample is. They would also need to know  how much vinegar to use on the materials.Lastly they would need to know how many samples of each material.The would need and the substance size.
-1	China's panda eats bamboo and almost nothing else. Australia's koala exclusively eats eucalyptus leaves. They are both different from the python because they are are carnivores and the koala and panda are herbivores. Also, people keep pythons as pets but pandas and koalas are not. In the text it says pythons are generalists, and koalas and pandas are specialists.
-1	Both pandas and koalas eat almost exclusively one type of food. However, the python, a generalist, can adapt to most food sources.
-1	Based on the data table each trail for each type of plastic was fairly similar. Also from the table it is clear to see that plastic is was the most flexible as it stretched 22mm in the first trial and 23mm in the second trial. Plastic A was  the least flexible.The first trial stretched 10mm in length and in the second trial 12mm.Therefore out of all the plastics, plastic B had the greatest stretchability. However, one way the results could have been improved is by measuring the length (mm) of the plastic when they break or even after a longer period of time.This will show the true stretchability of each plastic. Another improvement could be naming types of plastic that were being future trial can be done and the best plastic could be put to good use.
1	According to the student's data, plastic type B had the greatest capability of stretching because it stretched an average of 22.5 mm. Plastic type A only stretched and average of 11 mm. One way the students could change the experiment is by cutting each plastic sample length may be a contributing factor affecting results. Another way to improve the experiment is by taping all the plastics at the same place on the table, so an equal amount of plastic is hanging of the edge.
-1	In conclusion plastic type D was the most strechable (streched 20mm) and A was the least (streched 10mm). Therefor type D would be the best choice. The design could be improved by adding a controlled, and by adding the new much the weights were.
-1	According to the data table plastic type A was the most strechable. Type B and C decreased when measured again after having placed weights and type D stayed the same. Therefore, type A was the most strechable considering the longitude it made by 2mm.
-1	In order to replicate the procedure, you need to know when other materials you will need, what samples you need.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialist is a very picky animal. For instance the panda eats nothing but bamboo, and the koala bea, only eats eucalyptus leaves. These to animals are different then python because pythons can live in a lot of places.
-1	"Pandas and Koalas are both specialist. A panda which eats almost nothing but bamboo has to stay in its own habitat. Much like the Koala ""which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively."" These two animals are different from pythons because pythons are generalists. They can live in multiple habitat around the world not just one."
1	To replicate this experiment, you would need to know, how much vinegar to use in the samples, two, how big the pieces of rocks are,if they are the same or not and think you would need to know more about the containers, do they need a lid to cover evaporation, how large are they. More specific information is need to replicate this experiment from the procedure student here.
-1	3. place marble, limestone, wood and plastic into separate containers. ^p 4. Let them sit for 24 hours and remove them after and rinse them with distilled water. ^p 5. Allow the samples to dry for 30 minutes.
-1	The students could of lable the chart better than the did. The could have one add more info to the procedure and state why they are doing this experiment for.
1	Based on the data, I would conclude that plastic type B stretched the most, as it had an average of 22.5 mm stretched. One way the student could have improved his experiment design would have been to add another trial so that the results would have been more valid the to more results to a range. Another way the student could have improved his experiment would have been to give a specific mass for the weights attached to the plastic so that other people can do the experiment and get the same results.
-1	The way you would replicate the experiment is by repeating the procedure but just use a different sample ingredent.
-1	Additional information that I would need in order to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar to put in the different samples, what the constant variable is and how to determine the mass of each sample.
1	Two ways the students could have improved this experiment could have been by telling me what they were using as weight. And also, how they were measuring the plastic after the trial was over.
-1	China's panda bears and Australian koala bears are similar because they are not really a part of the food chain. Pandas just eat bamboo while koalas eat eucalyptus leaves. They are different from pythons, because pythons will eat whatever they can find weather its a rat, a bird, or even a crocidile. Pythons are able to alter an ecosystem.
-1	"The China's panda and australia's koala bear are both specialists. They both eat a specific food. The panda eats almost nothing but panda. And bear ""eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively."" The python is a generalist which means it can adapt to different types of food; that also makes the python less stable i like the specialists."
-1	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they both eat only a specific resource to survive off of. They are different from pythons because the pythons will eat anything anywhere the climate is suitable.
1	Plastic B had the greatest stretchability the students should have included how much the weights they used weighed and how many weights they used. Also they should have included another trial.
1	Osmosis is the passing of water through the cell membrane. Through osmosis, water can freely pass through the membrane. Diffusion is the passive transport of substances through the cell membrane. In passive transport, substances can freely pass through the membrane without requiring energy from ATP.Active transport is the passing of substances through the cell membrane through transport systems. These require ATP for energy to pass the substances through the membrane.
-1	Four different samples ^p Pour vinegar in each ^p Place a sample of one material ^p After 24 hours, allow samples to sit out for 30 min ^p Determine the mass of each sample.
-1	Pandas and koalas have the similarity that they can soon be going extinct. They are both different from pythons becase as the article says, lately they're population has been increasing which leavs the extination rate.
-1	Due to the data each time the student adds weight the plastic length seem to increase after the amount of time. For example I the type A plastic the first experiment is different their the seemed on because the doings strecht the plastic more after the first trial. The two ways I believe the student should have improved the experiment is by using different kind of plastic and weights.
-1	a) I conclude that plastic B has the highest tensile strength. B) They could have said how much weight to add. As well as add a different amount of weight for the second trial (preferrably a higher amount).
-1	After reading the group's procedure it states that you first need to determine the mass of the four different samples, then pour vinegar in a container and after 24 hours remove the samples from the containers and rinse each with distilled water. In order to replicate this experiment, I would have to know how much vinegar should be added to each container with the samples.
1	You would need many more pieces of information to replicate the experiment. You would need the type of samples to begin with in the procedure. You would also need to know the amount of vinegar used in each container. You would also need to know exactly how to mass the samples and what types of container to use (plastic for example, might alter the results).
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both eat from some type of plant. In the article it says that pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo and koalas in Australia eat eucalyptus leaves and these both are produced by a plant. They differ from pythons because they won't adapt as well to a different habitat like a python would. Pythons are like humans and can live almost anywhare, where as a panda or koala bear couldn't.
-1	Pandas and koalas are similar a like as being from the same family but both live in very diffrent habitats. There diffrent because even tought all 3 animals are dangerous you can only keep one as a pet and thats a python.
1	To replicate the experiment I would need to know the samples that I will be using. I would also need to know how much vinegar to use. I would also need to know what type of containers to use.
