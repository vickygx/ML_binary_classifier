-1	To replicate the experiment you might need to know how much vinegar to put in the cups.
1	1. Firstly, the group could provide more information about the materials such is what they are, how big they are, what category the material needs to be in order to conduct this experiment ^p 2. The group does not explain how much vinegar should be poored into the container- how much is needed? ^p 3. The group does not tell what should be used to take out the sample from the container. Even though this is just vinegar, their procedure does not follow the safety rules of the lab. Goggle inclusion would also be rise.
-1	After I had finish reading the information,I think I would need four types of vinegar but identical and four containers then I would need to determine the mass of each sample.
-1	Some additional information I would need in order to replicate the experiment would be how much vinegar do I put  in each container. Also what am I supposed to label the container? I'm not quite sure how to measure the mass by using  a scale?. If so, the same scale for each sample. Also, how big are the samples sapposed to be?.
-1	Two ways that the students could have improved the experimental design and for validity of the results was probelly trying the experiment with a bigger cup not a small cup. Second would be then potting more weight to the cup and then maybe their would be a difference on the experiment.
-1	A) Plastic type A stretched the most, (2mm) and type D did not.stretch at all. ^P B) All plastics started at the same length. Make sure the temperature is the same.
1	To replicate this experiment you would need the following information. You would need the amount of vinegar, the students used, you would need the type of samples they used and would also need the type of containers that were used. Also you would need the starting masses of each of the samples that the students used.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia. Both of these animals however are different from pythons. Pandas that live in China eat almost nothing but bamboo. Koalas in Australia eat almost exclusively eucalyptus leaves. Pythons eat a variety of food, and can live in the U.S from Cali to Delaware in the southern half. Pandas and koalas are specialists because they eat and adapt very well to other environments. Pythons are specialists because they can adapt.
-1	In the information they talk about all the procedures that the students did on there experiment. The students listed  everything  but they didn't give us the time they started. So you will know when to start the 24 hours. So you can drain them and let them come out.
-1	To replicate this experiment, you would need to know the mass (amount) of vinegar used in each cup. It is also necessary to know the temperature of the room that the experiment was performed in. A different temperature could speed or slow the reaction in each cup. The last piece of information required would be he size of the cup used in the experiment. The volume of the cup and/ or the shape of the cup could completely alter the results of the experiment.
-1	The students could have impared the experiment by doing the amount many times to check if it was accurate.
-1	The 3 pieces of information you would kneed to know in order to replicate the experiment is, you need to know how much vinegar you are going to pour in each container, how big in diameter the marble are and what is the mass before you put the marble in the vinegar.
1	(a) A conclusion that could be drawn based on the students data is that plastic type B can stretch the most with T1 being 22mm and T2 being 23. And plastic type A stretching the shortest with T1 at 10mm and T2 at 23mm. ^p (b) The student should have made sure that all plastics strips are the same length and the student should have tape all the stips in the same spot.
-1	To conclude, plastic type B stretched more in trial 2. It stretched 23mm, the plastic that least stretched was plastic type A. It only stretched 12mm for trial 2 and 10mm for trial 1. This means plastic B is the strongest and plastic A is the weakest, also plastic D stayed constant for trial 1 and 2.
-1	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they are specialists. They live only in these environments because of the bamboo and eucalyptus. They can't live anywhere else or they wouldn't survive. They are different from pythons because pythons can live almost anywhere. Potentially from Delaware to Northern CA. offering a wider range.
-1	Plastic stretched the most it had stretched 22 mm and 23mm. Plastic A stretched the least it stretched 10mm and 12mm. The students would have improved they experiment by writing more details like writing what was the begging length and write how much the weights weighed. They also could have put an experimental control like using a piece of metal instead of plastic.
-1	The conclusion I can draw from based on the student's data is that A.B increased, while C decreased and D stayed the same. 2 ways the student could have improved the experiment is by 1st the way the decided to do the experiment. They should have checked to see if after the 1st trial if it would go back to its normal form. 2nd: They should have mentioned what the size was before the experiment was started.
-1	I can conclude that plastic C is the weakest out of all the plastics because it stretched the most. One way that the students could have improved the experiment is to do more than two trials in each plastic because two trials is not reliable enough. also, the students should have checked the length of the plastic at different time intervals, like every minute, so you could see how the plastic stretched over time.
-1	a) Based on the students data, I can conclude that the amount each plastic type stretched at consistent rate during both trials. ^p b) The student could have improved the experimental design by specifying how much weight was being added to the plastic samples. They could've the validity of the experiment by trying different amounts of weight with each plastic sample.
-1	The three pieces of information needed is, which container kept the same mass when vinegar was poured? Which container lost less mass? Which container lost more mass? You could also need to pour more vinegar to each of four separate containers.
-1	To test four different polymer for stretchability the student would need to record the data from the investigation to procedure, and perform a second trial exactly just like the first trial. Two ways a student could improve the experimental design and the validity of the result is first off, could try two more 'test' trials to see if the plastic type and amount stretched can be improved, second off, could use the conclusion to help out with the experiment.
-1	The additional information you would need is to describe the four samples you are using because it doesn't say which samples to use in the procedure. You would also need to know to determine the difference in mass because the procedure only tells you to find the starting and ending mass. You would also need the samples to dry for more than 30 minutes to get better results because the original results didn't have a large difference in mass.
-1	To me I think that this experiment will need to tell what you have to repeat in the bottle and give more examples about what they are doing to make this experiment working.
1	As a conclusion to the data shown on the table, plastic B had the most stretchability. According to the data collected, the information is reliable because, the amount stretched in T!wasn't too different than T2. -The student could've made the experiment more reliable by specifying the exact length of each plastic to start with, and made them all the same. Also the student should've been exact about the weights and made sure it was the same for all of them.
1	After reading the procedure some things are still unclear. They should say what 4 samples are being tested, not just ''mass 4 samples''. Also, how much vinegar should we pour, and in what sort of container? What should we lable the 4 containers as ? How should the samples be removed from the container ? And as always, what are the materials we need, and our there any important things to note regarding lab safety.
-1	In the article it is stated that python is a generalist species while a panda or a koala is a specialist. What this means is that specialists clearly need an environment that they have fully developed too so they can survive ( the need for bamboo and eucalyptus leaves, Whereas pythons can survive anywhere as long as there is some temp influence on them and that is the difference.
1	A good procedure would show a little more information such as,  how much vinegar you pour into each container. It should also tell the size, and or type of containers used in this experiment. Also for it to be more accurate they should have started by making sure each sample has equal mass so it is easier to determine the resaults.
1	One process used by cells is endocytosis.  In endocytosis, the cell engulfs a particle or another organism by completely surrounding it and turning the space with the particle into a vesicle.  This vesicle can now travel into the cell.  Also exocytosis is used by cells to get certain materials to leave the cell.  A vesicle is created around the particle which is then transferred outside of the cell membrane.  Another process used by cells is diffusion through protein channels.  The directs for a protein channel to be opened up in the cell membrane, and diffusion then takes its natural course of moving from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration until equillibrium is reached.
-1	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are different than pythons because; pandas and koalas only eat plants and it's usually one kind of plant, whereas the python eats meat.
1	In order to replicate this groups experiment we would need to know the pH of the vinegar, how much vinegar was used for each samples and specifics such as the type of material used, ie. balsa wood compared with pine or type 2 or type 3 of plastic.
-1	A) Overall in this experiment trial 2 had stretched more than trial 7. ^p B) Try adding more weight to the plastic bags and let the weights hung on the bags for a longer period of time.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia in that they are specialist species because they only eat and can survive off of specific food (bamboo and eucalyptus leaves). Pythons are different because they are a generalist species and survive in different parts of the world eating the different native animals that inhabit wherever they are.
1	DIFFFUSION, or the spontaneous movement of a substance from a high concentration to a low concentration zone;FACILITATED DIFFUSION, or when diffusion occurs through special protein channels located in the cell membrane;ACTIVE TRANSPORT, meaning that the cell invests ATP in order to transport substances in or out of the cell up the concentration gradient by special protein pumps.
-1	To replicate the group experiment you would need to add information even as if the lab is valid.
-1	China's panda and Australia's koala are similar in what they eat. China's panda eats almost nothing  but bamboo, a Australian koala eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. This animals have different python is that they are capable of being around humans.
1	You would need to know how much vinegar should be poured into each of the four containers, you should also know what the acidity of the vinegar is so  that you wouldn't use a stronger or weaker PH level. You would also need to know if you need to incubate the containers so that their environments remain constant.
-1	The students conclusion of this trial would be, plastic type 4 produced 10mm of streching for T1 and T2 produced 12mm so it increased by 2mm. Type B produced 12mm of strechability for T1 and 23mm for T2 for an increase of 1mm. type 3 produced 14mm of stretch ability for T1 and 13mm for T2 decreasing by 1mm. And lastly type D produced 20 mm of stretchability for T1 and 20 mm for T2. That's what a students conclusion would look like.
1	To replicate this experiment you would need to have a list of materials so you would know which samples to use, you need to know how large the samples are, and you need to know why you are doing the experiment.
-1	"Pandas and koalas are similar in that they are both endangered and they eat mostly one thing, ""China's panda, which eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's koala bears which eats almost eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively."" (Achenbach 5). These two are different from pythons because pythons will eat almost any thing."
-1	Pandas and koalas are the same because they are vegatarians the eat leafs and because they are harmless.
-1	In their procedures they would also have to include on how to find the difference in mass. They would have to state that you need to subtract the starting mass from the ending mass. In order to replicate this investigation it is necessary to know now much vinegar is needed in each of the containers. We would also need to know what the units are if their grams and mls.
-1	"Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia. They are both specialist species. They both eat plants. They are both different to pythons because pythons are generalist. ""A generalist is a raccon, pythons..' ""A specialist is China's panda or Australias koala."""
-1	To replicate this you would a hypothesis. Also some other information would be amount of vinegar and amount of each sample. You would not be able to retest this experiment this information. One other thing you might need is a control for the experiment, something to compare the results with.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koala's in Australia because they both eat one specific food that their habitat has. On the story it said pandas eat bamboo while koala's eat eucalyptus leaves. They are both different from pythons because pythons can't eat only one thing and they are generalists.
1	a) No conclusion can be drawn from this experiment because the length of the plastic before the weights are added we not listed. Therefore you can no see wich plastic stretched the farthest. ^p b) Two was they can improve the valitity of this experiment are 1. list the length of the plastic before its stretched and 2. state how much the weight weigh and if they all the same.
-1	a- From looking at the student's data from their experiment, trial 2 had better results than trial 1. In trial 2, they could have done the producure more like the instructions tell them to instead of doing half. ^p b- I do not see anything that they couldhave done differently.
1	Cells use many types of transport to move substances across the cell membrane. Active Transport is a process used where the cell uses energy and transport proteins to move substances in and out of the cell. Osmosis diffuses water molecules into the cell across the cell membrane. And finally, passive transport requires no energy and moves with the concentration gradient to move substances across the cell membrane via transport proteins.
-1	Additional information I would need to know to know is how much vinegar I would need to put into each up. This information would make sure that I get the same results every time. Instead of putting too much or too little of the substance.
-1	The student could of improved their experiment by leting it stretched a little longer or add another clamp to the plastic sample.
-1	The polymer type B had the greatest stretchability because its average amount stretched was the greatest. At 22.5mm stretched average it was higher than type D's 20mm average.Types A and C were less stretchable than type B by 11.5mm and 9mm respectively. The valiability of the results could be increased by the reasing the amount of trials. This way the averages would be closer to what they should be. The design also could be improved by starting the weight of the weights. 2000kg and 200g would be a kings difference on results.
1	A conclusion based on the table is that plastic type B was the strongest because stretched very much and it did not break. Two ways the students could have improved the experiment is specify how much weight to add to the plastics, and tell us how long the plastic samples should be.
-1	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they both eat they're same food everyday they don't change their diet.
1	In conclusion, plastic type B had stretched the farthest. The two types were both pretty constant with ie newl have menis. A way this student could have improved this was by telling us how what the original measurement the plastic type was. Therefore we could see how much it's stretched. I think these types could have done another trial to make the experiment a little more valid.
-1	a. Plastic type D stretched the most and A stretched the least. ^p b. They could have done a 3rd trial they could explain what brand of plastic each type was.
-1	In order to rept this experiment they could have multiple trial. And also kep the lab going for 48 hours in place as they also need ti have a TV and DV content.They also could or tabled their data up and made a graph to show increase or decrease
1	Plastic type A stretched the least. They could have made this environment better by telling all this you what the plastics were. They could have said how much weren't they used. They finally could have said what the starting length should be.
-1	A specialist is China's panda, which eats only bamboo and Australian koala that only eats eucalyptus leaves. While the python is a generalist, when is a human being who with the assistance of tech can live anywhere fro Florida to Antarctica.
-1	You need to add to number 4, it should say how much distilled water, for number 24 it should say how much vinegar.
1	A conclusion that can be drawn based on the students data is plastic type B is more stretchable than the others because in T1 it stretched 22mm and T2 it stretched 23. The other 3 plastics didnt stretch as far as plastic B. Two ways the students could've improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results is did a third trial, and measure how far the plastic was on the edge of the table.
-1	How much vinegar you will need to put in the container, what is the control variable, what's the dependent  and independent variable.
-1	Koalas and pandas alike are specialist, they both rely on one food so once. For example pandas only eat bamboo and koalas only eat eucalyptus leaves. Both species are different then cobras because they are specialists and cobras are generalist so they can survive on multiple types of food.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to Koalas in Australia due to the fact they are specialist. Which means they favor stability. The difference between them & the pythons is pythons are generalist that can adjust to change & in our changing World, They can do best in & around humans which koalas & pandas can't based on their classification.
-1	Pandas are specialists along with Koalas. They both eat a specific plant/tree, bamboo and eucalyptus. Pythons are a generalist pythons eat meat, any kind of meat and can live anywhere. When pandas and Koalas have specific places.
1	The student did a good job conducting this experiment. There was an indepent variable, the type of plastic, and there were multiple trials. The weakest plastic was B, because it stretched the most, and the strongest was A, because it stretched the least.^p One way the student could have improved this experiment would be by using the same amount of weight that was stretching the plastic. Another way could be by drawing a line on the plastic so they would measure it in the same spot, start and end.
-1	A panda is similar to a koala because it only eats one thing, bamboo. However a koala eats eucalyptus leaves. This differs from a python which has a broader diet which is why it can survive in more places. I can also tell that a python can eat different things because, swallowed an alligator. Also, the article states, ''you could probaly have pythons snacking up the Pitmeas river.''
-1	Polymer type C was the strongest plastic with only a difference or 1mm in two trials. This student could've listed the starting length of the plastic.
-1	A) Based on the data table plastic type A had the most amount stretched so it is the stretches. ^p B) One thing they could have done was add weight and see which one would rip faster another thing they could of done was add more time.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia b/c the panda only eats bamboo and the koala only eats eucalyptus leaves. They're both different from pythons b/c pythons eat rats. Which shows the panda & koala are both plant eaters while the python is a meat eater.
-1	Both China's Panda and Australia's Koala bear only eat esentially one type of food and rarely eat others. Panda's eat bamboo and Koala eat eucalyptus leaves. Although a python can adapt to eating any kind of animal.
-1	Conclusion, the tape has stretched more because of the weight level has a high level of density. To improve, they should make a bar graph.
1	I think that knowing the temperature in the envoment would be very useful, I'm sure it we heated the samples or froze the samples, we wouldn't get the same results. Also, we need to know what type of environment we should place this in. Should it be sunny, dark, windy, hot, cold, etc. I also think we should know what kind of container and how large it should be, we don't even know the right amount of vinegar to pour on the samples. This experiment is missing too much information.
1	Based on the student results, I can conclude that plastic type B is the most stretchable. In the data, plastic type B stretched to 22 mm on T1, and 23mm in T2. None of the other plastics had stretched as much. Then ways to improve this experiment is to add another trial and average the data. Also the student needed to tell exactly how much weight he clamped to the plastics.
-1	Atleast three pieces of information I would need to replicate this experiment is (1) what safety equipment should I wear? (2) The exact way to extract the samples from their containers (3) what do I need to determine the mass of each sample?
-1	I would need to know the amount of vinegar  added to each sample which have to be the same replicate the experiment.
1	a.) Plastic type B has the highest stretchabilty.^p b) The students could have improved the experimental design and validity of their results. They could have specified the amount of weights and kept that constant. Also, they could have done a third trial for each plastic to increase accuracy.
1	To replicate the experiment you wood need to no what materials they used for the experiment. Also you wood need to no how much vinegar they put in each of the containers. Finally you wood need to no what size the container is so that you can tell how much of the vinegar is tuching it.
-1	My conclusion from the data is that A streched 2mm, B streched 1mm, C streched 1mm and D stayed the same at 20mm. ^p Name the plastic being used. Add how much each plastic streched.
-1	Pandas and koalas are similar because they are both specialists. The panda eats almost nothing but bamboo: Australia's koala bear eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. A panda and koala differ from pythons because a python is a generalist with the assistance of technology it can live anywhere.
1	The first stepis mRNA connects to the ribosome to keep it in place.  Secondly tRNA brings the anticodons and they match with the bases pair.  On the third step another tRNA brings another anticodon and the amino acids at the end stick togather. And the fourth step is that these steps are repeated and all the amino acids stick together and form a protein until they get to the stop codon.
1	There are several pieces of information that needs to be added in order to replicate
-1	I would need to determine the mass of four different samples, then I would sample the marble of the starting mass, then I would make sure that I have labeled of all the samples of starting mass, ending mass and difference on mass. After 24 hours remove the samples from the containers and allow it to dry.
-1	"Pandas are similar to koalas because pandas eat nothing but bamboo and koalas eat nothing but eucalyptus leaves. Its also says in the Article ""they are both specialists."""
1	Based on the students data plastic B stretched the most with 22 mm for trial 2 and 23 mm for trial 2. These students could have improved in a lot of things. First off they could have been more specific in their experimental design. They could have been more specific and told how the weight of the weight was. They could have also added more trials to get a better result.
-1	First, you would need to gather all of your materials. That is important because you don't want to start an experiment and not have every thing ready. Second, you need measurements of how much vinegar or every experiment would be different. Lastly, you need to remind to make a control group to compare results.
-1	Pandas in China and koalasin Australia are similar because there is a low popabitial of both and they eat very specific types of food. But a python is diffent. A python eats almost anything. As the artical said, even alligaters.
-1	The panda in China and the koala from Australia are both considered specialists. This is because in order to survive they need a stable environment. The panda eats only bamboo and the koala eats eucalyptus leaves. This differs from the python which is a generalist. The python doesn't need only one thing to live off of because it is able to adapt.
-1	a) In conclusion, plastic type A is the strongest plastic and plastic type D is the weakest plastic because it streched the most. ^P B) the student should have made sure all the plastic lengths were equal. The experimenter should have also tested them all at the same time to get accurate data.
-1	To replicated the experiment, I would need to know the time at which they began and the time they ended at.
-1	China's panda bears are similar to Australia's kolas because they almost eat nothing all pandas eat is bamboo and all koalas eat is leaves. Both panda's and koalas are different from pythons because they're not as dangrous as them they dont spit out vinum and they mamals and pythons are Invasive species and reptiles.
1	In order to complete this experiment, you would need additional information. You would need to know the list of materials to have everything to complete your experiment. You would also need to know where the experiment was performed to weigh any outside factors. You might also need to know to know the constants. What type of vinegar, and what time you started.
-1	b) 1. Perform the second trial different than the first. ^p     2. Repeat with fresh plastic. ^p     3. Add more than one types of plastic.
-1	Additional information you wold need for this experiment is how much water was in each cup, you should also know if all the materials are close in size.
-1	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are different than pythons because; pandas and koalas only eat plants and it's usually one kind of plant, whereas the python eats meat.
-1	You would need to know how much vinegar to put into the cups, that way you would get more accurate results.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia b/c they're both a type of bear that like to stay up in trees $ eat one type of food other bamboo or eucalyptus. They are different from pythons b/c pythons eat meat like other animals $ they eat plants/leaves. Also pythons are reptiles $ they're mammals.
1	Some additional information you would need to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar needed for step 2, what size  you need to make the samples key and what kind of container you need to put the samples in.
-1	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know some background information on how much acid rain across each sample. Another piece of information needed would be is how much vinegar was pour into the separate identical containers. A third piece of information needed in order to replicate this experiment is how the gram measurements were taken use they taken using a gram soak? All of these things are needed in order to be able to replicate this experiment.
-1	I would have to check the mass of four different samples. Put vinegar in each one of the separate containers. Put a sample of a marble in one container and label it then repeat with the limestone, wood and plastic. While waiting 24 hours. I would remove the samples from their container and rinse them with distilled water then allow the samples to dry for an half an hour.
1	I would need to know if there was any specific material we needed like special wood or plastic. Some other information I would need is what kind of vinegar they used white or red. One last thing would be, does it matter what you dry them with just in case it could effect it
1	To replicate the group experiment you would need to know what size container the group used to hold the samples. You would also need to know how long to rinse the samples. You would also  want to know how they dried the material, if you want to get the same data.
-1	Pandas and koalas are similar because they are both specialists. The panda only eats bamboo, and the koala survive as on just eucalyptus leaves. A python on the other can adapt and is a generalist who can survive in multiple different areas.
-1	a)The amount stretched by T2 showed more improvement by having it stretched because the different material. Both were investigated at the same time. One place was more affected.^p (b)One way is is by maybe leaving it a little longer. Or use different types of weight.
-1	The panda in China and the koala bear in Australia are similar because they both only eat one specific food and are herbivores. Both animals are different from a python because pythons eat anything.
1	"Some additional information I would include on the group's procedue would be to specify the types of ""samples"" from the first step. Also, to tell what material or size the four identical containers should be. The way the masses were measuredshould also be included, along with the type of vinegar used to mock acid rain. The place and room temperature that the samples were put to dry should of been written as well. Lastly, they should have marbled a control variable such as all the samples put in with water instead of vinegar."
1	A) My conclusion based on the students data would be that plastic B has the highest stretchability. I say this because plastic B had stretched more in 5 minitues than any of the other plastics in this expirement. ^p B) There are many ways this student could have improved their designs. One way they can improve their designs is to provide the weights of both the samples and weights. They could have also add more trials to improve their design.
-1	"Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia by not eating meat including humans. According to the author, ""...China's panda, which eats almost nothing but bamboo..koala bear, which eats eucalyptus leaves"" In other words, they're different from pythons because they only eat thing from the earth."
-1	One way they could be more clear is by  using how much vinegar into the containers. Also they can write ho to much of the different are needed and if you need  to place the samples in a certain pt.
1	The additional information that is needed in order to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar that should be placed in each container. The amount of vinegar must be kept constant in order for the data to be valid. The results acquired from the experiment can be affected if the amount of vingar  was increased or decreased. Therefore, the amount of vinegar is needed in order to replicate the experiment.
1	Plastic type B is the polymer plastic with the highest stretchability because in both trials it had stretched the most. this experiment is not very valid because the different polymer plastics started at different lengths which may have an effect on how much it stretches. Also, the measure of the weights weren't specified.
1	You would need to know the size of the samples and how much vinegar to use. The size of the containers would also be vital to replicate the experiment.
-1	In order to replicate the experiment, i would need to know the brand of vinegar,
1	To replicate these students experiment you would have to know what the samples are of that you're using. You would also have to know where you're leaving these  containers. And lastly, to replicate this experiment you may need to know the type of container you're putting these in, that and / or the size of the original sample.
-1	Before the students put the objects in the solution, they should have weighed each sample. The students also should have had a control for their experiment to truly tell if their data was correct. To make their experiment better, they should repeat the experiment more than once to see if their data matches.
-1	Koalas and pandas are both similar in each other because they both require exclusive and specific habitats to survive. For instance, the Australian koala's diet consist strictly of eucalyptus leaves, as well as the Chinese panda bear which survives off bamboo. These two in comparen to the pythons which can survive in any environment that is warm.
-1	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are different from pythons because they are specialists, while pythons are generalists. According too RobRoy MacInnes, specialists favor stability and generalists favor change. Pandas and koalas are similar because they both live in only one area and eat the same food, but pythons differ.
1	a: Plastic type b has the most amount of stretchability in all the four plastics. ^P b: The students could have repeated the experiment a third time and made sure that they were adding the same size weights everytime.
-1	In the article it states that the Chinese panda and the Australian koalas are both similar because the panda eats bamboo and the koala eats eucalyptus leaves, these are both similar. The pythons are different because it is a carnivore which only eats meat.
-1	I think that these braid made to for the
-1	Pandas and Koalas are similar because they both eat plants wich makes them different to pythons. Pythons eat other animals and live in hot weather.
-1	How much liasis was used in each container,rinse with distilled water for how long .How much the container have to be.
-1	A) Based on the information it have plastic type B has a high stretchability compared to plastic type A whas stretchability is very low. ^p B) They should've added a materials so we know what they used to do their experiment. Also they should've wrote conclusion so we knew how their experiment turned out.
-1	Aluminum foil & Black paper is good to wrap around a cup because you could have one cup in any kinds of shape you want to the cup pluse using aluminum foil hold the cap real tight and the black paper you could put it wet. The alinum paper for it to look like some thing you want it to come out.
1	To replicate the experiment, a person would need to know how much vinegar is added to each sample. They would also need to know what containers they used. A person would also need to know if the containers were covered or not during the experiment.
1	Three process used by the cell to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are active transport, passive transport, and a semi-permable membrane.  Active transport is the process in which the cell moves materials across its membrane with the use of energy.  Passive transport is the movement of material across the cell membrane without the use of energy.  A semi-permable membrane is what helps the cell control what pass through the cell and how it gets in.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because both species eat only one plant almost exclusively. Pandas eat almost only bamboo, and koalas eat only eucalyptus leaves, so they are both specialists. They are both different from pythons because pythons are generalists, and can live in many places, unlike the specialist pandas and koala bears.
-1	a) Based on the data plastic type B was the best best plastic to resist the weight stress. ^P b) The student must have added a control group and performed more trials.
-1	Three additional pieces of information  I would need to replicate the procedure are to gather materials, use a control, and when it's finish to record the data.
-1	a) A conclusion in the student's data is that plastic type D stretches more than the other plastics do. ^p b) The student could have improved by adding on the procedure what types of plastics to use. Also the student could have added how much were the weights he used.
-1	A panda in China is similar to a koala in Australia because they are both specialists. A panda eats nothing but bamboo and an Australian koala only eats eucalyptus leaves. Neither of them could survive where their food isn't supplied. They both differ from pythons because a phython is a generalist who can live in at least one-third of the United States. A python doesn't just have to live in one location.
-1	The table characteristic property we formulate in the table because 10 +12=22 and amount stretched (mm) T1 = total is 44 and T2=600 the total att ch 9 clamp to the bottom plastic sample.
-1	In order to replicate the experiment, I would have to know the hypothesis of the experiment, because I am ensure of what i am testing for. Also, the problem to know what I am trying to prove, and the conclusion to see what resulted from the experiment, without these pieces of information included, it is difficult to realease the experiment because you were only given the procedure and not the full lab report.
1	A)In conclusion, plastic type B has stretched the most probably not the most dependable material. The best plastic type would be A. Plastic type A can withstand the most support of weight in the bag so you don't have to worry about it ripping. ^p B) These students should have conducted a third trial. It would have made for finding a better average of stretching on the plastic type. Also explain how much weight was stretching these plastic bags.
-1	Pandas in China are similar in many ways one of them is they both eat plant while the panda eats bamboo sticks and the koala eat leaves but they are different from pythons because pythons are mostly found in California while pandas are found in China also because of their appearance.
-1	The sample is marble, starting mass 9.8, ending mass 9.4 and difference in mass - 0.4. The limestone sample, starting mass 10.4, 9.1 ending mass, difference - 0.4.
1	Plastic B stretched the most out of all of the plastics. To improve this lab the students should give a specific weight to add so it is the same for all test+ should make a specific length for the plastic.
1	a) Plastic type B had the most stretchability while plastic type A had the least.^p b) All the plastics should be the same length. Make a machine add the weights and remove them and the clamp b/c a human may place the weight w/a different amount of force for every plastic.  Put two clamps instead of tape b/c the tape may evert it's own force while the clamps wont.
-1	Panda from china and koalas from Australia are in the very similar.They are both specialists.They live eating special plants like bamboo and eucalyptus leaves while pythons are very different.They can eat almost anything and kill only animals as a source of food.They are also eaten made pets so they have a better chance of survival.
-1	B, tell wat the a weightt of weights were.
1	A) A conclusion that I can draw from the student's data is that plastic type B stretched the most. I know this is accurate because during the second trial it come to be about the same. ^p B) To ways the student could have improved the experiment are ^p 1) He/she should have added how much each weighed and 2) He/she should have put the lengths of the plastics before they were stretched in her data.
-1	"Panda's in China and Koalas in Australia differ from pythons in that pythons are ""generalist"" whereas Koalas and pandas are specialists this means that pythons can thrive in multiple habitats, which differs from the pandas and koala's that need specifics (such as bamboo for pandas) to survive."
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists. They both only eat one type of food each. Pandas only eat bamboo and koalas only eat eucalyptus leaves. These animals are both different from pythons because pythons are generalists, which can adapt to eating the native species, unlike the panda or koala
-1	Both pandas in China and Koalas in Australia are similar because they they are specialist. This means that they would not be able to survive anywhere else because the certain food sources they need are only incaled in China and Australia. A python , a generalist is different because it can live anywhere on earth, as long as it has a climate that is suitable.
-1	Pandas and koalas are similar because they are both specialists species who only eat either bamboo (panda) or eucalyptus leaves (koala). They are different from pythons because pythons are generalists and are most abundant because they do best around humans ans can live basically anywhere while koalas are restricted to Australia & pandas to China.
-1	B) One thing they could've improved on would be the description on the steps, explain it more with detail. Another thing the students could work on would be to define the control. ^p A) Polymer Investigation.
-1	In the article it explains that pandas and koalas are natives to the country, while pythons on the other hand is an invasive species due to the fact that there not native to the U.S. but they're growing up any ways and causing problems unlike the panda who are just eating only greens.
1	A person trying to replicate this experiment would need to know what type of containers to put the samples in, how much vinegar should be added at the temperature that the containers should be kept under. All of these would be information a person trying to replicate the experiment would need to know.
-1	To replicate the experiment you would need to add as the first step gather all materials. In step two they should tell the amount of vinegar that was used. Step six should be changed to, after allowing each sample to dry determine the mass.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because the both feed off of one food source. The panda eats only bamboo while the koala eats only eucalyptus leaves. As said in paragraph 21, pandas and koalas are specialist. This contrast with the python which is a generalist and can adapt to different food sources in the area.
-1	The group of students didnot tell us the diffrent samples nor did their procedure tell you to find the starting mass and the difference in the starting mass and ending mass.
-1	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are both specialists; both species eat only a certain plant. The pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo and the koalas only eat eucalyptus leaves. Those two animals are different from pythons because pythons are generalists, which means that they can adapt to almost any also where as specialists cannot.
-1	There is much additional information necessary in these procedure in order for one to be able to repeat it in step 1, the four samples should be specified as marble, limestone etc as they were in the data table. In step 2, how much vinegar (ie in ml) should be desorined as  well as the type of container (a jar/plastic/beaker etc) also in steps vi, determining the mass could be also tried more by saying what type of measurement should be used such as beams. Lastly, there should be a step 7 directing us to find the differences in mass as it does in the data table.
-1	Pandas and koalas are both mamals and humb . They are diferent fromoe pythons is that they of warm and fluffy and furry and snake are scale and unapealing to the eye.
-1	In conclusion, based on the students data there are four different type of plastic. Based of the plastic are T1,T2 their amount stretched (mm). And based in the Dutch table T2 is more stretched than T1. The students can describe experimental based in diffent plastic . And the students can based in that data table the T2 is more stretched.
-1	After reading the groups procedure, some information I would need to replicate this experiment would be the temperature of the distilled water. Also, I would need to know how much vinegar that the group put in each cup. Lastly, you would need to do multiple trials for reliability.
-1	Since both pandas and koalas are vegitarians and are specialists, who according to the story need stability they are very similar. The author means that since the earth is rapidly changing koalas and pandas will if not already become extinct. Pythons can cooperate with change, especially since they are meat eaters. As long as they have more than one source of food their existence will be longer than koalas or pandas.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are specialist. Also they are similar because they eat plants. Chinese pandas and Australian koalas are different than pythons because a python is a generalist. Also pythons can live anywhere with the assistance of technology.
-1	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know what I would measure to measure the mass with a sale. Second, I would need to know to measure the mass in grams. Third, I would need to know if I should round the mass to the nearest tenth or hundreth of the gram.
-1	1. You would need an expiremental control having just vinegar. ^p 2. No more than one trial for each sample to have precision. ^p 3. You would need to label how much vinegar would be put in.
1	You would need a control to look back on, you would need to know how much liquid you would need to fill each container ip with and get the time right. With the days and stuff you would need to know all your materials.
-1	I would have to know how much of each sample I would need to put in the cup. As well as needing to know how much distilled water in needed after the 24 hours, also I would need to know where to place the containers after they need to sit for 24 hours. I would need to know all of this if I wanted to replicate the experiment.
-1	In the procedure it doesn't have a clear problem of what is happening on the experiment. On procedure 7, it doesn't tell you the trial that thy did for the first one. Two ways the students can aprove is on the last trial explains whats the first trial is and not make the person reading it not to know whats the trial is. The last way is for number four it says add weights to the clamp and alowthem to hange for 5 minutes. How heavy are the weights you need to use on the experiment.
-1	Some of the students do like measuring but also like using the data table to find out the stretched amount is in the chart.
1	"In order to adequately replicate this experiment, one would need more specific samples for example, instead of ""wood"" it should be a specific type of wood, marble, limestone or plastic. The procedure should also be clearer concerning how to use the vinegar in relation to the samples condition to remove such samples from the vinegar after 24 hours."
1	You also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each separate container, what types of container to use, and how long to rinse the samples with distilled water in order to replicate the experiment.
-1	I think from reading the procedure they should've added information describing the look before and after (see if there were any physical changes). If something was to change, then the group should've got it down so we know the features of the items.
-1	You would need the weight of the samples to see how much everything weighed.
1	a) Plastic B is the stretchial polymer or plastic low of the ones tested it can stretch the most. Plastic A stretched the least. ^P b) 1) The student needs to specify how many weights should be added & how much those weights shall weigh. ^P 2) The student should also have said how much of the plastic should be hanging off the table as this should remain the same for every plastic type they should be placed at the same points on the table.
-1	The additional information that I would need to know how many of each individual sample I am fiding the mass for; ^p They didn't say how much marbles or limestone or wood or plastic they just said a sample.
-1	A panda from china and a koala from Australia are very simmilar because they are both specialists. Panda's only eat bamboo and koalas exclusively eat eucalyptus leaves.This shows that they are unable to adopt , unlike a python whose habitat in Asia is simmilar to those in about a third of the continental united states.
-1	Plastic B is the most ductile, followed by plastics D, C, and A, respectively. When discussing the validity of the experiment, it is best to have an average of the two trials. Also, this person did not include the initial length (unstretched) of the plastics. They should have all been cut to the same length to start with.
1	To replicate the experiment, I would have to know the size of its containers I use. Also I would need to know how much vinegar they poured in. Lastly, what is the sample material thats a major part of the experiment.
-1	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know how much Vinegar I am putting into the four containers.
-1	I would say one piece of information they forgot was the amount of vinegar they put in each procedure.
-1	"Panda's in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both only eat one type of food. It says ""panda, which eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's koala bear, which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively."" They differ from pythons because pythons eat a variety of different animals."
-1	A.) The conclusion I have drawn about the students data table is that plastics A and B where stretchable. While C actually decrease in size and D did not stretch at all. ^P B.) Two ways that the student could improve this experiment is by naming the different plastics so you know your not looking the same kind of plastic that then once. Also to add more trials because they only held two.
1	Based on the data, plastic type B stretched the most out of all of the plastics. Type A stretched an average of 11mm, type C stretched an average 13.5mm and type D stretched 20mm. But type B stretched 20cm but type B stretched the most with an average of 22.5mm. ^P B) The student could have improved his experiment by telling how long the plastic was as well as how the weights weighed. Another thing the student can do is add one more trial.
1	The students wanted to determine in this experiment which type of plastic A, B C, or D was able to stretch the most. Based on the data, plastic B had the best stretchability and was able to stretch 22 mm in the first trial and 23 mm in the second trial. The students could have conducted more trials to improve the validity of their results. To improve their experimental design they could have been more specific and stated how many weights should be added to the plastics and to better control the experiment.
-1	The China's Panda and Australia's Koala are simillar, because they do not eat meat but they eat want cames out from the general. The are different from pythons, because mostly the python would prefer to eat meat and not leave or bamboo.
-1	You would need the starting mass, ending mass, and difference in mass.
-1	You would need the the for sample rocks ,vinegar but what we don't know is how much vinegar fore the plastic containers, put the rocks in the containers in different and then tape and label what kind of rock, then pour vinegar , leave for 24 hours to dry to used which stone is better, after 24 hours time to longer  from the container, leave stons sitting for 30 min to dry so that they can be examined (but each or that you should measure the mass of rocks in amount of viner thats being put in,then after 24 hours measure mass and record all the data.)
1	In order to replace the experiment yal would need additional information including four different samples of what specific material. Moreover yal would need to know the temperature at which the samples were kept. Lastly how much vinegar is reacted for each indivual sample.
-1	How much vinegar do you pour in the four containers.
-1	This table is not so clear it only has the dependent variables. It's still missing the control group. The indepent variable is the change in mass. The purpose of this experiment was to see the different mass for four different samples.
-1	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know: ^p 1. how they got the mass of the four different samples ^p 2. A list of constants ^p 3. You would have to know how much of a sample you would place into the container of vinegar and if it's the same for all four materials.
-1	Pandas and koalas are a like because they only eat a certain type of food and a familiar to one region. Pythons however eat what can fit into their mouth and are spread over several different regions and are contng to spread endangered the southern U.S.A.
-1	You got to put more Vinegar in wood so it make no different in mass in plastic out a little not more Vinegar so it could do more reaction.
-1	a) The conclusion to my investigation is at the end of my investigation plastic D came out even in the second trail for (T1) and (T2) when stretch. ^P b) Two ways the students could have improved the experiment is by telling us what plastic to use. For example, plastic bottle or wrap. Also, telling us how long do they want the plastic stretched.
-1	China's panda bear is almost similar to Australia's koala bear because the panda eats almost nothing but bamboo and the koalas bear eat eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. They both are different from pythons.
-1	You would need to know how much vinegar to poor in each container you would also need to know how much sample exactly do you have to put in each container the last thing i would need to know is what to label the mass of the sample.
-1	In order to replicate this experiment I would need to know what materials I needed, what kind of sample and how much of it.
-1	After adding I determined that
-1	(T2) Had stretched more than trial (T1) for plastic type A, B. Then (is was lower than T1 then plastic type D was exactly the sam.
-1	For each box, they should have done it 3 times so they would have an average.
1	a) Plastic B is the most elastic because it had the highest average amount stretched at 22.5mm. Type A was the least stretchable at an average of 11mm. ^p b) The student have given a specific amount for the weight to be used. In addition the amount to be off the table should be given because the amount hanging off affects how far it will stretch ^p and controlled for each trial.
1	a.) According to the student's results, type B plastic was longer in length and stretchable. Plastic A seemed to be the least stretchable butonly at a length of 10-12 mm. ^p b.) The student could have been to say how much weight to put in the clamp so it could be a constant variable. Also, the student could have put the initial length of the plastic with the results to see which plastic had stretched the most.
1	a The group would have said how much vinegar to add to each sample. ^p b The size of each sample should also be stated because size difference would affect the results of this experiment. ^p c Would need to know what materials to gather.
1	To replicate the experiment,you would need to know the amount of vinegar in step 2. In step 4, a person would need to know the temperature the 4 'samples' are waiting 24 hours in. In step 3, the procedure states a sample of one material unless the 4 materials were given to the experimenter bit ready the procedure, the actual names of each of the materials should be given. Temperature for step 5 would also be good additional info as well.
-1	"Pandas and koalas live in one specific area, china or Australia limited by its habits. Each animal ""eats almost nothing but bamboo, or... eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively."" A python, however, adapts and changes, giving it many options for survival, such as Asia or its now USA home."
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia, because of the limited food that they eat. Pandas almost only eats bamboos and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves. They both are different from pythons because pythons are heavy meat-eaters; and pandas and koalas are vegitarian.
-1	The additional information I need in order to replicate the experiment is independent and the dependent variables. The materials needed to conduct the experiment. This experiment also needs trials.
1	In order to make the group's experiment more replicate, the first thing that should be done is to include the they materials used as independent variable. Secondly, how much vinegar should be added to each sample? Thirdly, in order to both make the experiment more replicate and improve the validity, a control should be tested. In an experiment like this, the control could be either the ending materials left dry or they can be sorted in distilled H2O.
-1	The pandas in china are similar to koalas in Australia.The article in paragraph 19 through of explains how both of these animals eat nothing but the same food over and over.How the pand eats bamboo and the koalas eats eucalyptus.Both these animals eat plants and they are both different from python's because the koalas and panda are not meat eaters.The article says that the python is generalist.
1	From the student's experiment I can conclude that plastic type B was able to stretch the most while plastic type A stretched the least. However, these students need to improve their experimental design. Two ways that is possible would be to give definite and constant stretching results for each sample as well as defining how much weight should be used and where the clamp should be placed exactly. This would definitely improve the validity of their results.
-1	China's panda eats almost nothing but bamboo tha is why China's panda and Australia's koala are similar because Australia's koala they eat eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. and China's panda and Australia's koalas are both different from pythons because pythons don't eat the same.
-1	Both pandas and koalas are specialist rather than generalist. Pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo and koala only eat eucalyptus. They arenot generalist like the. python and cannot just reincase and adapt to any habitat.

1	Nor.
1	A conclusion that can be drawn from the data is plastic B is the strogest tape out of the other 3 plastics. (T1-T2, T2-T3) plastic D was the second strongest and plastic A was the weakest plastic and the second weakest was plastic C. Two way the student could have improved the experiment is by using tighter tape for tyding the plastic and act the 4 top plastic types in the wand.
1	As one way of controlling the movement of substances across the membrane, cells use selective permeability. Selective permeability is the process by which cells decide which substances should go into or out of the cell and which shouldn't. Cells also use passive transport, which requires no energy from the cell itself, to do the same thing. Finally, cells use active transport, which goes against the concentration gradient and requires cellular energy. Two types of active transport are endocytosis, the process of letting materials into the cell, and exocytosis, the process of expelling wastes and other unwanted materials from the cell.
1	this experiment ^p In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar put on the container, the size of the samples I'd need to know with what they measured the starting and ending mass of the samples, what kind of container do i have to use.
-1	Another trials, the amount of vinegar used and no changing of time to make sure it's accurate. Because if not youill change the experiment. By changing the most important things.
-1	a. After time the maximum stretch of a palmer goes down and becomes stronger. ^p b. He could of made the laties longer of tell how much waits you were adding.
1	The conclusion drawn from the data would be that plastic type B stretches the most, because it was the longest length after being stretched. The student could improve the experiment by adding more trials, to get more data to drawn make accurate conclusion from. The student could also cut the plastic to the same starting length in order to ensure that they all have the same start, and the results would be more accurate.
-1	I think what I will do is to change the procedures. Instead of leaving the samples sit for 24 hours, I'll let them sit for 48 hours, I'll let them dry for 60minsand
-1	"Pandas and koalas are both specialist animals, ""A specialist is China's panda which eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's koala bear, which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively."" Pythons on the other hand can survive anywhere that is worth making them generalists, their food source isn't going anywhere and they can adapt to a change in their food diet."
-1	We would need to know the time between the starting point and the end point.
1	"Based on the results from the data table, the two trials do not differ much but the second trial had a couple longer length, so something could have been done differently from the first trial. The data should that plastic B stretched the farthest during the first trial and that it is the ""stretchiest"" the way the student could have improved the design or validity of the results is to repeat it 2 more trials exactly like before to ensure the results are accurate. A second way the student could have improved the experimental design is to say how much weight to add to each plastic, instead of just saying changed."
-1	Pandas have a low population, just like the koalas in Australia. Their population is shrinking, just like the koalas population. They are different from pythons because they as not eating endangered species like pythons are.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because China's panda eats nothing but bamboo and Australia koala bear eats eucalyptus leaves. And there both different from pythons because in the article is stated that python swallowed and alligator.
-1	Pour the same amount of vinegar on all four. After you determine the mass of all four samples find out the different of each from first time you did it.
-1	Pandas are similar to koalas because both of these species eat only 1 type of food, pandas eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus. This 2 species are different from snakes because they are not reptiles, also they don't eat meat. For example tourists found a snake that had exploded with an alligator in its mouth.
-1	In order to replicate this experiment, you should know how much of each sample you were supposed to start with, what you were trying to determine from this experiment and you should know how the containers were kept room temperature outside etc.
-1	"a) Plastic ""D"" length did not increase or decrease in both trials. ^P b) One way student ^p could have improved the experimental design by letting it hang for more time to see how it was affected when it stretched. Since their results in both trials were close, they shouldve tested it rersus another."
1	After reading the group's procedure, in and for me to replicate this experiment, I would find need to know how much vinegar to be poured n each container, the size of each container and how long each sample is to be washed for. Me knowing these three additional sources of information I could successfully replicate this experiment.
-1	One way the students can improve there experiment is to do a other trial to see if they misssted anything.
-1	1)Say what you are trying figure out in the first place. ^p 2)It's not enough into figure out what is going on. ^p 3)We need to know more clearly how to do each step.
-1	The information that I would need to replicate this experiment is the same type of samples they used. The other thing I would need so that the experiment could be valid is the time they started with, which is the starting mass. Last but not repeat all the steps they did in order to have o valid experiment.
1	Concluding from the students data that plastic type B was the stretchiest, while type A is the least stretchy. Two ways that the students could have improved their experiment is to have described how much height to use. Another way that they could have gotten more valid results is clarify how much plastic to use, hanging of the table.
1	a. Plastic type A was mide of the least amount of polymers because it stretched the least, and plastic B was the most. ^p b. The students could have written the measurements of the plastics before they stretched them, and they also could have specified how much weight they held part on the clamps.
-1	a) Based on the students data, plastic type B stretched the most at an average of 22.3mm, while plastic A stretched a mere 11mm average. Plastic D stretched the second most with an average of 20mm and then plastic with 13.5 average mm. The average in stretchability is due to the different chemical composites of each plastic. ^p b) The student could have improved the validity and design by recording how much weight was used, which would allow someone to replicate the experiment and recording the percentage stretched rather than just how much. A sample that is 10cm but stretched 10mm is a much more significant change than one that is 10 meters and stretched 10mm, but the data table fails to recognize that.
-1	My conclusion is that plastic type D is best because the amount stretched stayed the same throughout test trial 1 and test trial 2. Two ways the students could have improved the experiment is allow the weights to hang longer than 5 minutes, and or add a heavier weight.
-1	This data is not accurate becaus they got a different number all the time and they only got the same number once.
-1	From the students data from conclude that type D is most stretch able and that type A is the least stretchable. This lab couldn't been improved by saying to record the measurements in steps 7 & 5. Also by taking what until to measure with, in steps 7 & 5.
-1	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are both similar. They are both similar because as said in the article they are both specialist that need to inhabit certain areas because they only eat a certain food. But they are different from pythons because pythons are able to inhabit different climates and eat different foods as other generalist animals.
1	To repeat this experiment, I would need to know the four different  samples without knowing that I don't know what I'm testing. I also need to know how much vinegar in each of the 4 cups. I would need to know where to put all of the different containers. I don't know if they need to stay at room temp, cold or not.
-1	To replicate the groups procedure I would need for them to tell the reader how much vinegar to put in the containers, how much of one sample material do they want, and how they want us to determine the mass.
-1	Based on the student & data i can draw the conclusion that plastic type A only stretched an average of 11mm so it was the strongest and stretched out of all the other plastic types. ^p b. The student could have improved the experiment by doing one more trial for a total of three trials for each plastic type for accuracy and he/she could have measured the initial length of the plastic.
-1	"Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they are a specialist species. Although they both eat plants, it is specialized which plant. They are different from pythons because pythons can eat a variety of things, therefore is a specialist. It is even said that, ""a generalist is a racoon, a python..."" while ""China's panda eats almost nothing but bamboo."""
-1	"Pandas in China stick with one type of food, bamboo. The koala in Australia sticks with one type of food too, eucalyptus leaves. A python, on the other hand is not picky. In fact there is a picture that is mentioned in this article "" A python swallowed an alligator""."
-1	They also should watch how all the samples change and take notes. See if any of them dry slower then others or faster and why might they. Then see how it changes during the day.
-1	(A) A conclusion based on the student's data is plastic type A produced the most amount of stretching from trial 1 to trial 2 (10mm to 12mm) compared to all the other plastic types. However, plastic type D remain the same and on one of the plastuc types C, the amount it stretched decrease from 14 to 13. ^p (B) Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design of the result are instead of using one type of plastic, they should have used various types to broad the results. Also the student could have done more trials.
-1	Pandas are similar to Koalas because they eat nothing but eucalyptus. They are different than pythons because pythons would eat any thing.
-1	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are both specialist species, therefore rely on stable environments in order to survive. Pythons however are a generalist species which means as the article stated that they can survive in numerous conditions with the help of adaptation.
1	I would need to know how much vine
-1	A) The plastics stretch about the same amount in Trial 1 and Trial 2 but the 4 plastics amount of stretch differs greatly. ^p B) The students could have done another trial or change the experiment up a little bit.
-1	(A) My conclusion on the expirement is that, plastic type D has the longest mm stretched out. (B) (1) The student have put the plastic on a hanging string was a steamy, boiling pot of water. (2) Then, the student could have recorded more valid, and improved data on a chart.
-1	So they should of told us if we have to wait five wen for all three bottles or do we time it different one another. Also do we use the same length for all three plastic bag or are we spouse to use a different length for all three plastic bag.
-1	Some additional information could be the amount of vinegar poured into the containers or they could state what they used to determine the mass of the samples. Also since there is multiple varieties of plastic.they could state what kind of plastic they used.
-1	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they only eat one thing. Pandas eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves. Pythons on the other are completely different because they have a large variety of what they eat. In 2005, a python swallowed an alligator, and later the python itself blew up.
-1	Pandas in china, and koalas in Australia are similar, because they both eat one main food source. These animals have not been around humans, unlike pythons. The difference between pythons and pandas and koalas, is that pythons can live anywhere and are most abundant. They can also do well around humans, as stated in paragraph 20.
1	"In order to replicate the ""acid rain"" experiment it is essential to know what the samples are.In the step 1 it says to determine the mass of four samples. What are the samples? Also, how are we supposed to find the mass of the sample? In step 2, it says, pour vinegar in each four seperate but identical containers. What is the size of the container and what type of vinegar is used? Also in the 4th step, it says, to rinse each sample with distilled water. For long should the sample be rinsed?"
-1	The information that you would need in order to replicate the experiment are a control group. Also, what are the four different samples? Another additional information would be a graph to chaw what happened and a conclusion.
-1	A conclusion drawn is that the results were fully accurate and had little change during the second trial. The students could have included a diagram to give a better picture of how the experiment should look like and a good info and results have at least 3 trials. So the students should have done another trial and drawn a diagram.
1	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each container. Also, I would need to know what samples I am using. I would need to know what size or shape of container to use. Finally, I would need to know exactly how each samples is to be put in and removed from the container.
-1	"Pandas and koala's are similar in they're eating habits: ""China's panda which eats almost nothing but bamboo or Australia's koala bear which eat leaves almost exclusively. They differ from pythons because the article explains how pythons eat all of the habitats native animals causing potential extinction where as these 2 bears do not."
1	In order to replicate this, I would need to know what the 4 samples this are testing for, so you don't know what to test. Also, around how much of the samples do you need? 100g or 50g or 10g. Also, how much vinegar to pour into each container. They must should be specific. They could have also added what to measure in grams, kg, lo etc. They should have also told what type of area to keep the samples in, Light/dark,warm/cold.
-1	Pandas in china are similar to koalas in Australia because they both eat food that grows in their area.Pandas eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves. Pandas and koalas are different from pythons because pythons can adopt to a new environment more quickly then the pandas or koala can. pythons often do best around humans where as pandas and koalas do not.
1	A) Based upon the data plastic B was the most flexable while plastic A was the least flexable. ^p B) The students could improve the experiment in two ways 1. Add a constant amount of weight to each clamp for each experiment. 2. Create a constant starting length for each sample and measure for the increase in length.
1	This information needs to be added to the procedure in order to replicate the experiment; ^p -Amount of vinegar poured ^p -Identify types of samples used in the procedure ^p -Temperature and ^p -Size of containers_open/closed lid
-1	The pandas in China and the koala's in Australia both are specialists because of the limited diet they have unlike the python who will attempt to eat almost anything. For example, when it said that the python ate an alligator. Most animals have a routine diet.
-1	If you wanted tor replicate the order then you would have to double everything in the mas trials that were provided for you.
1	In order to replicate the groups experiment, I would need some additional information.I would need to know what types of samples to use what kind of containers to use and how much vinegar to pour into each container.
-1	The first starting mass was for wood 11.2g ending mass 11.2g and difference in mass 0.0g. Second was limestone with starting mass 10.4g, ending mass 9.1g difference -1.3g. Third starting mass was marble 9.8g ending mass at 9.4g and difference in mass -0.4g. Last was plastic starting mass 7.2g ending mass 7.1g difference -0.1g.
-1	One idea they might need to use, is to say what four materials/sabstones are being used in your procedure. Also they should be sure to use a control in this experiment(missing). The group should also  used more than one trial to their experiment/lab.
1	Additional information that would be how much vinegar would you need to pour into the containers at the beginning of the procedure. Also what type of containers should you put the samples in? How big should they be. Another thing would have to be how big all of the samples need to be so the results come out right.
1	You also would need to know how much vinegar to use, what kind of vinegar to use and the 4 different samples.
1	a) In conclusion to the results it can be said that polymer B is the most stretchy, followed by D, then C, then A. The only problems, is that you can't accurately judge it because you can't tell if they are all the same beginning length. A conclusion would only work if they were the same starting length. ^p b) One way to improve the design would be to specify the beginning length of the polymer strips. Another would be to indicate the amount of weight attached to each polymer.
1	In order to replicate this experiment, there are a few more things I need to know. The problem does not state what the four different samples are. Second, I would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each cup. The amount of vinegar could impact the mass. Last, I would need to where to store the samples for the 24 hour period. Different tempuratures might affect the different samples.
-1	The connection between the pandas and the koala bear from the passage was used as an example. That both animals have the same eating habits of how often they eat something. The panda eats mostly bamboo while the koala bear rarely eats eucalyptus leaves. That how pythons would react.
1	The first thing is that the students needed to specify their samples in the procedure instead of just being general saying samples. They also need to tell you to find & record the starting mass of each sample. You'd also need to know how much vinegar to pour into the contairs. Finally, they need to say at what temperature they should sit (room temp).
-1	A). The data that  the students recorded is incorrect. ^p B). Two ways the students could have improve  the experiment by adding a control and by adding another performance trial to the experiment.
1	I would need a list of materials and know what type of equipment to do this experiment on. I would also need to know the problem to this experiment. I would also need to know how much vinegar to put in to the containers and what size pieces is use to do this experiment.
-1	Pandas are similar from koalas in Australia because na China specialist. States that China's pandas eat bamboo and Australia's koalas eat eucalyptus leaves. Both eat a plant/leaf. They are both different from a python because a python can live where ever and pandas and koalas can't without assistance.
-1	For one thing to replicate the experiment one would need to know how to determine the mass and the group must state how to do this in their procedure. They also should state to use, the same mass objects so that it is easy to replicate. Finally, the group should use a control to compare their results to and for replication of the experiment.
-1	Pandas and koalas are similar because they're both specialist species, they only eat a certain type of food in a specific area, but pythons are generalist species and can adapt themselves to eat anything.
-1	A) Based on the data shown in the table. One strongest type of was plastic B. But plastic D had a costant amount of stretch. ^p B) One way the student could have improved the experimental design was by including how much weight to add. Also to compare the results with any other student who performed his same experiment.
-1	Plastic type B is the polymer with the most stretchability. At the end of the experiment this is apparent because in both trials it stretched the most mm. Two ways to make the experiment better would be to leave the weights on for a longer period of time and also to add more weight on another was would be to make the experiment better would be to leave the heights on for a younger period of time and also to add more weight on. Another  way would be to use a double thickness of each material in evert trials.
-1	The information i want is the measures how much did you put in each cup put the table in order from small or large.
1	In order to replicate the experiment there is some information that is needed. The size of the container needs to be determined. also, the procedure just says four different samples, it never says what there needs to be a number for how much vinegar needs to be poured into the containers. Finally it doesn't say how long the sample should be rinced for. If those things are included in the procedure then the experiment could be duplicated.
1	In order to replicate the experiment I would first need to know the amount of vinegar that the samples were placed in. Secondly, I need to know on what I should place the samples on, to allow them to dry. Lastly, to replicate the experiment I need to know the control group and the type of container I should use. Also it would be necessary to know what I should weigh the samples on.
-1	"The relationship is that the panda & koala eat differently when the pythons. ""Panda eats bamboo, koala bear eats eucalyptus."" Also change favors the generalist, the python, & stability favors the specialist, panda & koala."
-1	They didn't mention how much vinegar to put in the containers. This could effect the mass of the object at the end. They should specify how much to use and how big the containers are plus mention what the material the containers are.
-1	This group needs a control. They need something that won't change. They also need them to have all the ^p samples with the same starting mass. Lastly i was never told how much vinegar i should into the container. ^p That is important to know because you cant guess for how much to put in.
1	In order to replicate the experiment, you need to know what the samples are taken of, what size the samples should be, what size the containers should be, and how much vinegar is to be used on each sample.
-1	In the end, trial 2 of the experiment had stretched a couple mm longer, a part from plastic D, than trial 1. This experiment can be improved by keeping the weight on for 5 minutes longer to give a better result. Another way it can be improved is doing one more trial to get more results to compare for the lost mass to improve it is adding another plastic type to provide a variety of plastics.
1	Plastic type B stretched the longest of them all with 22mmfor its first trial and 23mmfor the second trial. They could have improved the experimental design by measuring to make sure that one type of plastic isn't longer than another type. They also could have done another trial for more accurate results.
-1	a) After review of the results one can conclude that plastic type B as the most stretchable and durable this is because it had the highest mm stretch  distance for both trials.^p b) the student could have improved the results validity by performing 2 more trials after 2 minutes. By giving the plastics time to recover he can either test the durability over time.
-1	The students still need to make a hypothesis, a graph and find the difference in mass.
1	In the conclusion of the experiment plastic type B stretched the most to 22 mm to 23 mm. While I thought plastic type A streched the least 10 & 12 mm. Two ways that these students can improve their experimental design would be having more variables controlled such as how much weight to put on to the clamps. Also, the students got include the starting size of the plastics so it is hard to conclude any of their data.
-1	A) From this data you can conclude that. There really wasnt much of a change and that T1 bag is stronger. ^p B) The student need an control and also need to be more spcific. when it comes to the weights.
1	In order to replicate the experiment I would need to know specifically what materials to start with and the amount of vinegar that I should pour into the four cups. I would also need to know where to store the cups. It would be helpful to know what technique that they used to rinse each sample as well. Much more information is needed in order to accurately replicate this experiment.
1	A) I conclude that plastic A is the strongest because it stretched the least in both trials. ^P B) Two ways the student could have improved the experiment are doing another trial and including the length of the plastic, rerare adding the weights, in the results.
-1	Pandas from China and koalas from Australia are similar because because they both eat on specific food all the time such as pandas eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves. These animals are both different from pythons because pythons can eat a wide variety of things such as mice to aligators as stated in the artical in paragraph sixteen.
-1	To repeat this experiment you would need to get the average that was used in the last procedure and let it sit for twenty eight hours instead of twenty four then rinse and record the changes in mass.
-1	"Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they both only eat one major food, grass and bamboo. They like plants. "" A python swallowed an alligator-there's not a delicate way to put it-exploded."" (pg. 5) Pythons tend to eat a lot of food, with a variety, especially meat. That's way they differ from pandas and koalas."
-1	This procedure of acid rain tells about the starting mass in grams.They gave foour different samples but they didn't include a explanation way they were putting acid rain on the samples.The purpose of this experiment is to show the starting mass, ending mass, and the difference in mass i grams and it was compared to the different samples.
-1	A. Plastic B stretched the most. Plastic A was the strongest out of all. ^p B. They should have added more weights to see which would have stretched the most and which would be stronger.
-1	In order to replicate the experiment, you should measure the amount of vinegar added in each container. You should also measure the mass of each sample before adding them to the vinegar. Lastly, you should measure the amount of vinegar left after the material is taken out.
-1	"Panda bear and koalas bear are similar because like the article writen by Joel anchenchach says,""A specialist is a china's panda which almost nothing but bamboo or Australia koalas bear which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively"" It shoes that both pandas and koalas are specialist unlike pythons who are generalist."
1	In order to replicate the experiment I would need to know how much of the sample is put in,also how much vinegar to pour in. I would also need to know what  I am measuring the mass in,grams,etc. If I had the names of the samples then it would be easy to replicate the experiment. They also need say where to place the samples,a counter,in the sun,in the closet,they say nothing. Also the biggest of all what am I taking this for?
-1	To replicate the experiment you need to know how much vinegar to put in the containers, there needs to be a control, and you also need to know the shape of the objects because shape could have an effect on how much material gets dissolved.
-1	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know the amount of vinegar used, how moch sample there was and what times the experiments were preformed at.
-1	Pandas and koalas are similar because they are specialists and a python is different because it is a generalist. According to the article racoons, pythons, cock roaches and white tailed dear are all generalists, therefore a generalist can live anywhere with assistance of technology.
-1	The things that they could've included would be, that they need a constant, they need to specify how much vinegar is in each container and also to include the number of trials to do.
1	You would need to know that the vinegar is the substance that is being used for the acid rain. You would also need to know what type of materials you need. Another piece of needed information is how much vinegar to pour into each container because the more vinegar added,the stronger it may become and therefore the vinegar would be able to eat away at the samples more. You would also need to know where the containers were placed for the 24 hours (whether they were placed at cool temperature, hot or cold.)
-1	The koala and the panda are similar because they don't eat meat or other animals.''China's panda which eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australias koala bear, which eats eucalyptus leaves.'' Both are different from the python which is a carnivore and the python is much more dangerous.
-1	As stated in the story, koalas and pandas are specialist species. Or species that can only live in one area because their main source of food can only be found there. They differ from pythons because pythons could live in a range of areas and still be able to hunt for food.
-1	Pandas in China are different are similar to koalas but different than pythons because they are considered specialists. The article states that a python is a generalist and is similar to a raccon, cock roach or white talled deer. Generalists are things that can live anywhere.
-1	China's Pandas and Australia's koalas are similar because they both are very picky on om what they eat and both eat some kind of plant but on the other hand pythons will eat almost about anything.
-1	I would need to know how much vinegar to be able to do this experiment.
1	To repeat the experiment you waid first have to know how much vinegar to pour into each of the containers. You would also need to know the amount of each sample that was measured to get their masses. You waid also need to know if you should cover the samples and at what temperature they should be left to sit in for 24hrs. Also, what would you do with the samples once you removed them from the containers, where would they sit?
1	Some additional information you will need are the material. You also need to know the size of the contaneir to measure how the acid rain effected it. You need to know how much vineager is used for each sample. Another thing that would help is to know how big the sample stones are by measureing  the best possible way.
-1	"China's pandas and Australia's koala are similar because "" They eat one specific thing that is always supplied for them by nature so they can easily be affected by human in the general. A python will eat almost anything making it a generalist. Generalists can adapt to humans and there ( are more successful ."
-1	In conclusion T2 was mostly longer than T1 because T2 had more higher measure than T1. One way this student could of improve is he could of put heaver weights. Another was he could of done it was he kept reducing the tape size.
-1	They are different because they live in different enviornments. pythons are reptiles but a panda and koala are not and they wouldn't eat other reptiles.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both eat eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. They both are different from pythons because pandas and koalas been in there see that they live in but the pythons came spreading in 1992.
-1	They are similar in the way that they eat food that don't cause any harm to people or animal. The panda eats almost nothing but bamboo, and a Australia's koala eats eucalyptus leaves. And they are different from the pythons because the pythons is a reptile that can eat or harm anyone.
-1	Additional information would consist of its shape, resistance and total masses lossed to complete the experiment.
-1	Pandas and koala bears are similar because they both are a specialists species. They are both different from pythons because a python is a generalist species so it eats a wide variety of things. While the panda and koala are specialists species because it generally eats one specific object.
-1	Pandas and koala bear are similar because according to the article the almost eat the same types of foods and these food are the only parts they eat. They both are different from pythons because they are more of a threat and according to the article the pythons population is still getting bigger, also pythons an pandas and kolas live in find different climate around.
-1	In order to replicate this this experiment youwould need the starting mass, ending mass and difference in mass.
-1	a.) After testing this experiment, the results show that plastic sample D stretched the most (mm), making it the weakest plastic. Plastic type A appeared to have streched the least amount of mm, making it the strongest plastic. b) The students could have made this experiment more valid by adding a controlled group. They could have also done a trial in order to increase the validity of their experiment.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to Koalas, they are both in the family tree. Pandas and Koala are much different from Pythons because Panda and Koala are mammals and pythons are reptiles with cold blood.
-1	The information that you will need is the measurement, hypothesis conclusion because you want neccessarily find out what will happen next without these three things. These are the main things you need to replicate the experiment.
-1	"Pandas in China are similar to Koala in Australia because they both mainly rely on one food source and don't go around eating anything and everything like the python. "" A specialists is China panda which eats almost nothing but bamboo or Australia's Koala bear which eats eucalyptus leaves exclusively. ""( Achenbach 5). This shows the two have eat only one type of food rather than eating everything around them."
-1	"Pandas in China, as well as Australian koalas differ from pythons because they are both specialists, and the python is a generalist. Generalists have a much easier time surviving because they are able to adapt much easier. The Chinese panda, ""... eats almost nothing but bamboo, ]and] Australia's koala bear ...eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively"". These animals adapt like the python can and there more have more rise for survival."
-1	*Include the name of the samples in the procedure. ^p *Say how do students measure the mass. ^p *Ask students to obsecvate the data and drawn conclusion.
1	Passive transport, active transport, and diffusion.Passive transport is things leaving and entering the cell without using any energy.Active transport is using energy to move things into or out of the cell.Diffusion is when an area of higher concentration moves that substance that it is concentrated in to an area with a lower concentration.
1	To replicate this experiment we would need to know what type of samples we are determining the mass for. We would also need to know the amount of vinegar to put in each cup. We would also need to know how to dry them at is by cloth or air drying. And we would need to know the mass of each material before the vinegar.
1	After reading the group's procedure, additional information that is needed in order to replicate the experiment is:How much vinegar was used, how big the containers were and on what should the samples be placed on to dry (tinet paper towel in the sun.etc)
-1	This similarity between the pandas and koalas is very simple they're both peacefull also they can both climb trees. On the other hand a python is different if it fierce and dangerous if let out it can cause harm to people and animals.
1	a. Plastic B was the one with the most stretchability, plastic D came next followed by plastic C then A. ^p b. The student could have included how much the weights weighed. This would make the experiment valid when reproduced. ^p Also, they could have included the initial length of the plastic before it was stretched.
-1	Pandas & koalasare similar because they onlyeat bamboo, and eucalyptus. When apython eats the such as other animals even crocodiles.
-1	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because of their classification as a specialist species. The article sides that these animals are specialists because they eat almost exclusively are species. What a python is however, is a generalist. The article claims that generalists not only eat in wide range of food but they also can live in various areas and adapt very quickly to change. Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are specialists, and that's why they are different from pythons.
-1	"Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they are ""specialist"" species. They only eat certain types of food, so they are limited to certain environments. Pythons are different because they are a ""generalist"" species. They can adapt to different environment and the food they eat is more common worldwide."
-1	My conclasion is that T 2 had a better amount stretched than T 1 had. Also T2 had more plastic types than T1.
-1	Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design  or validity of the results is they could be more specific  and could of wrote a conclusion saying which plastic type has more stretchability instead of drawing a data table. To show how much a the stretchability of each plastic.
-1	To replicate the experiment, you would need to know how much of the sample to put in each container, where they stored the containers for 24 hours, and where they put each sample when they removed them from the containers and rinsed them with distilled water and let the sit and dry for 30 minutes.
-1	The first thing that they are missing is the amount of vinegar. They didn't go into enough detail on what their experiment is about.
1	The first type of movement is called active transport. In this kind of movement the cell has to use energy to transport substances across the membrane. This type of movement requires energy from the cell. An example of active transport is moving particles from an area of lesser concentration to an area of greater concentration. The next for of transport is facilitated diffusion. In this type of transport the cell does not use energy. An example of facilitated diffusion is moving particles from an area of greater concentration to an area of lesser concentration. The last process is passive transport. This is when the particles move with the concentration gradient and require no energy.
-1	"Pandas in China and Koalas in Australia are similar, but both are different from pythons. In the article it stated that mammals l ke these . (pandas and koalas) are ""specialist"" and can survive only in specific areas. On the other hand, pythons are generalist and can live in many different areas as shown in the map in the article , while , pandas and Koalas need specific living conditions, pythons do not."
1	As shown in the data table, I can conclude that plastic type B was able to stretch the most in the 5 minutes.  The table also shows that plastic type A stretched the least, concluding it was very strong or had less polymers. Two ways the students can improve their experimental design would be to make sure that all the plastic samples were the same length. Another way the students can improve the experiment would be to include the weights so an independent variable can be clearly stated/seen.
-1	A) My conclusion is that the expirement was very un organized and not well thought - out. ^p B)These student could have improved their expiremental design by one, telling us the materials they used like what kind of plastic objects they used like whether or not they were strechable. Just to give us more of a second thought about how theyre data came out. they could have organized their data alot better.
-1	I would need to know how to determine the mass. Specifically the size the materials containers were and any other controlled variables such as the type of vinegar or the temperature to ? the containers at for 24 hours as well as other storage conditions such as in direct sunlight.
-1	Well you would need samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water. Three pieces of information, limestone, plastic, marble.
-1	Pandas are similar to koalas because they are both specialists. For example bamboo is to pandas as eucalyptus leaves is to koalas. These two species are different from snakes since a snake is a generalist species. Snakes are generalists because they can adapt to many different locations where as pandas are stuck on China and koalas are in Australia.
-1	Pandas & Koalas are similar because both eat one kind of food( bamboo & eucalyptus leaves). A python however, eats meat.
-1	Pandas and koalas are both extremely picky eaters. The article says pandas, eat only bamboo and koalas, only eucalyptus leaves. Pythons are different, because they can eat almost anything their jaw can fit, and that is many things.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are two animals that are specialist and are found to be harmless, because it says in the article they only eat plants. They are both different from pythons because they are not seen no a threat. Where as pythons are a threat even to other animals like in the article a python ate an alligator.
-1	a) As a conclusion based on the data T2 plastic tests were more elastic than Ti. ^p B) The student could improve this by addressing how many weights were used and allow them to hang for at least two minutes more and to get new plastic tap instead of using the remaining 3.
-1	One conclusion that I can draw from this experiment is that plastic B stretched the most for both trials. 2 ways to improve the validity would to be add a control (no weight) and see if it stretches and the size of the plastic sample, just to make sure that every plastic is the same size to start.
1	The replicability isn't very good because there are rather vague directions one improvement would be to measure ad how many milliliters of vinegar would be poured into each container so the amount of vinegar can be a controlled  variable, like 100ml per container. Also, the procedure needs to state the temperature at which the containers at for 24 hours at, so the repelilicn can have the same temperature. Also, there should be a certain amount of time to rinse the samples with distilled water, such as 10 seconds each so the samples have been equally rinsed.
1	b. The student should use all sample plastics of the same length so the strength and stretchability can be determined. The student should have also done atleast one more trial to eliminate possible experimental error. ^p a. From the experiment, plastic type B came to be the most stretchable. Plastic type D was also very stretchable and the second stretchiest, plastic type C came after B, and after C, came plastic type A. Plastic A was the strongest but plastic B was the stretchiest.
-1	a) The second try has almost the same amount of stretchability the first try has. ^p B) When added weights allow them to stay for more than 5 minutes. ^p Or they could of stretched it out more wider.
-1	You would need the information to know how much vinegar to pour into the container, the information to know which sample had the greatest difference in mass, and the information to which material to use in step 3.
1	Plastic type B was the most stretchiest (22&23) & plastic type A stretched the least. Plastic type C (A&B) stretched the second least while plastic type D stretched the second most and was constant with 20mm. The students could have improved the design by creating more trials for more valid results. More trials can show a trend in the data while only two can't. The students also should have clarified how much the weights should weigh when added and when to add them to the clamp.
-1	A) Both Trial 1 and Trial 2 are basically the same and their constant to each other their wasn't a big change.^p B) Maybe for step 4 they could add more time and get heavier weights.
-1	One conclusion it can draw based on the student's data is that plastic type B is stretched much more (mm) than the other three types maintining the amount of 20 mm in both trials. Based on the data. Plastic type A is less flexible stretch 10mm in the first trial an 12 in the second trial. The student could have stated that they started out with unused plastics and record their initial stretch.
1	active transport- active transport is when a cell uses energy to transport substances across the cell membranepassive transport- passive transport is when a cell transports materials across the cell membrane without the use of energyosmosis- osmosis is the transport of substances through the semi-permeable membrane (water)
-1	The group would need a problem hypothesis and a conclusion of what happend in this experment these 3 things would make the experiment a whole lot better it would ready state what they are trying to figure out.
-1	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they both are exclusively eating one food. ''A specialist is China's panda, which eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's koala bear, which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively . ''But they are different from pythons because pythons eat a much more vast assortment.
-1	After reading the group's procedure they would need these four samples they need need to put down what there procedure is about.
1	It is necesary to have a constent for each of the four different samples. The constent would be using water instead of vinegar in the containers with the the samples. Also the students did not state how much vinegar they put into each container.
-1	A) Plastic type B had the most amount of stretch compared to the others.^p B) The student should have specified the length because without a starting length, his data is inconclusive. The student also should have specified to hold up or attach the clamp to something so the ends would be equal. In his procedure, it seems like you put weights on it while it hangs loosely.
-1	The student used different plastic to determine its stretchability. She took a sample of one of the plastic & measured, she added weights on the plastic to see how far it would on.
-1	Additional infomation that you would need to replicate this experiment is to remember to write in the procedure to record data. Also name the four different samples you will be working with. Also make sure you work with one sample at a time.
-1	a) Plastic type B has the most stretchability with a difference of 2 to 3 mm with type D that has the second most stretchability followed by type C with a difference of 10-8mm with type B, and type A with a difference of 4-1mm with type B. b) He should have specified the total weight of the weighs and clamp he used to stretch the plastics. It also could have measured all dimensions length, width, heights of the plastic types rather than just the length.
1	1.     -Osmosis is how water gets diffused thru the membrane. 2.     -Active Transport is where an enzyme opens the cell membrane for an object to come in, and extra energy is needed to assist the object into the cell.3.     -Passive Transport is where an enzyme opens the cell, but the object doesn't need the extra energy to come in.
-1	After reading their procedure, I don't even know what they are trying to do. If it was my procedure, I would try and make it more clear so that the person reading it knows what going on. I would add how many times to measure the mass and when to or now as well.
-1	After reading the students procedure, i though that they needed to add some things in their graph. What about the 24 hours? Didn't they  say after 24 hours but did they do this experiment at school? Because if they did, then they can't stay in school for 24 hours a day. How about the containers? Lastly, negative numbers? In mass, I never knew that you can have negative grams.
-1	In this experiment plastics A and C where the ones that streched least B and D streched the most Plastic A in T1 streched 10 mm and in T2 it streched 12 mm. Plastic B streched 22 on T1 and 23 in T2 C streched 14 in T1 and 13 T2. D streched 20 in T1 and 20 in T2. So the are that streched most was Plastic B. I think the students could of improved the experiment by changing the way the streched to how fast you can rip and puncture also put less plastics to try.
-1	They both live in cold area and feed on the same food and a specialist is China's panda that, which eats cucalpptus leaves almost exclusively and species like these become more abundant.
1	In order to complete this experiment I would need to have
-1	Pour vinegar in each of four separate, but identical containers. ^p After 24 hours, remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water. ^p Placing a single sample of one material into one container and label. Repeat with remaining samples placing a hours remove the samples from placing a singl.
-1	An additional information that i would need in order to replicate the experiment
-1	Pandas are similar to koalas bears because they don't eat meat. Pandas eat bamboo and koala bears eat eucalyptus leaves. They are also similar because they are mammals not like pythons because they are reptiles and pythons eat meat.
-1	The question in this experiment is how many weights did it take take for the plastic to inicate while measuring. The conclusion was that T2 was more of a success. One way the student could have improved was explaing how heavy each weight was and how best you should add each weight to the clamp. Another way they could've improved was using the exact type of plastic with the same measurements.
1	Osmosis. The movement of water across a selectively permeable membrane.Active Transport. The movement of particles through a membrane against the concentration gradient.Passive Transport. The movement of particles through a membrane with the concentration gradient.
1	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know additional information such as the four different samples that they used (because I could have choosen metal, carbboard and many other sample materials that they didn't use and would get different results. Also I would also need to know the amount of vinegar to pour because this can caute a major change. Lastly, they might want to tell where to sit the samples while they dry for 30 minutes because if they are sitting in room temp. or by a light source makes a difference too.
1	a) My conclusion is that plastic B was the stretchiest. ^p b) To improve experimental design and validity, the student should have specified how much weight he used to put on the ends of the clamps to stretch the plastic. Also, there should have been a control to compare the results to at the end. Also, there should have been a third trial so the experiment would be more valid.
-1	China's panda is similar to Australia's koala because they both eat specific food ( bamboo, eucalyptus leaves) The panda and the koala are different from the python because the python can eat meat for example when the python swallowed an alligator in 2005.
-1	Some additional information you would need to replicate the experiment is in the proceeduce include, what type of samples your using, also do explain why you are using vinegar. Finally, to tell the reader what your weighing with and why.
-1	Plastic type A held up best against the wheight of the wheights. So I would use the plastic out of any where. Plastic type D expanded and stretched the most. ^p Two ways the student could have improved the experiment was, one; name the plastics and two; tell how much the wheights wheighed.
-1	The pandas in China are similar to the Koalas in Australia because they only eat one thing in specific, the pandas only eats bamboo s the koala eats eucalyptus this makes them different from the python because the pythons can eat almost anything. For example they can eat mices/rats/reptiles/birds and so on.
1	According to the data, plastic B seems to have stretched the most, while plastic A stretched the least. ^p The experiment could be improved in two ways: The plastics' length was not constant and will affect the results. The plastics should be a set length. The weight of the weights should be specified so that others may similarly recreate the procedure.
-1	A China panda eats almost nothing, but bamboo koalas bear eat eucalyptus leaves, those two animals are similar because they both eat a food amount of leaves or something that is green. Those two animals are different from pythons because pythons hurt and wrap their pray around them. Panda's and koala bears stay in rain forests, pythons you will mostly catch them in an hot enviroment.
-1	From reading this article I can say pandas in China are much like koalas in Austrailia because both animals eat mainly one food. Pandas like to eat mainly bamboo and koalas like to eat mainly eucalyptus leaves. This quality puts both animals in the catagory of specialists. This differs from python because pythons are generalist. The article says generalists are human beings that live anywhere from Florida to Antarctica to outer space, unlike pandas and koalas.
-1	a) The plastic did in fact stretch only in to 23 mm ^p b) The student could have used more weights on the second trial, or maybe on the second trial let it beng longer.
-1	Pandas and koalas are similar because they are both specialist animals meaning they can only live in the habitat they already reside in, China and Australia. They are different then pythons because pythons can live almost anywhere.
-1	You would need to indicate what types of materials are beeing used in the experiment. You would need to know how much vinegar is beeing used. You would need to know how long to rinse the samples for, as well as the amount of distilled water beeing used to rinse them.
-1	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar to add to all of the containers. I would also need to know how much of each sample I would need to get before testing, lastly, I would need to know what the control of the lab is in order to be able to draw conclusions about my results.
-1	Say the amount of vinegar put into each cup, how do you determine the mass ? And
-1	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they eat the same thing all the time. Koalas eat eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively and pandas eat nothing but bamboo. Snakes eat mice and other things that are etable for them. Any thing that alive and they can put down there mouth.
-1	To replicate the experiments you will need all the samples and how you will need more acid rain.
-1	"To replicate the experiment, I would give the required tools in a list so people can be more prepared, I would also be more specific on the word ""samples"" to describe rocks and stones. And most importantly I would make a control, I would put marble, limestone, wood and plastic in water."
-1	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar in that their food sources (bamboo and eucalyptus leaves respectively) exists only in certain areas of the world and so those animals exist only where those food sources are. They are specialists, and are favored by stability. They are different from a python in the the python can eat a variety of food sources around the world so it can exist in many different places.
-1	To make this experiment more accurate and the no to replicate it, I would need to the near of the 4 different samples in seat 1. Ake what are its materials/containers can't in step 3. And finally I would need to know what to measure the samples with, what kind of units.
-1	In this experiment you will need to add more information like in the produre like how did you set up the sample to begin off with. Also it never said that the samples were in a container and need to include that in the beginning. But it did  look like a good experiment to do and how they poured vinegar on each sample and let it sit only the Limestone changed the most and the other sample stayed almost the same in the start and end mass.
-1	I think that they needed to u the time on the box using all the other sample and show how long it stand there threw are where experiment.
-1	After reading this group procedure, some information that I would need is replicated this experiment is how to find the mass of the sample, what is the control for this experiment and how much vinegar needs to be poured into these containers. Without this information it is experiment would not be considered valid. There would be no control samples the amount of vinegar may not be the same and there is no information is no information on finding the mass.
-1	In order to replicate this experiment you would have to include the measurements of liquid to pour in each containers, to identify each of the samples of decks you are putting in the container and label the containers.
1	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each cup so each sample is equal. I would also need to know the location of where the containers should be put during the 24 hours (ex: shade/sun). Lastly, I would need to know what kind of container should be used; a plastic, a covered or a dark container etc.
-1	(a) In conclusion plastic type B was the strongest because it stretched the longest, Plastic A stretched 10 mm and 12 mm. Plastic B 22 mm and 23 mm and plastic C 14 mm and 15 mm and plastic D 20 mm and 20 mm. this data states that plastic B was the strongest. (B) One way he could have improved the experiment  is by having all the plastic equal in size and also he could have added the same amount of weight.
-1	In my experiment  I would include steps: ^p 1. Gathering materials. ^p 2. Observation of the substances. ^p 3. Making sure no particles were lost in the rinsing of water.
-1	You would need to tell us how long it stayed out there.
1	Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are sodium-potassium pumps, endocytosis, and exocytosis. Sodium-potassium pumps remove three sodium ions and recieve two potassium ions through a passageway in the membrane. Endocytosis is a process in which a group of phospholipids surrounds a substance outside of the cell in a circle and carries it in to the cell. Exocytosis is the same process as endocytosis except that the substances are removed from the cell instead.
-1	Plastic type B was the stretchiest plastic type. It listatcched a total of 45 mm plastic type D was second it stretched  a total of 40 mm plastic C was the 3rd stretchiest it stretched a total of 27 mm and plastic A was the least stretched it stretched a total of 22 mm.
1	The experiment was very precise and contained multiple trials that proved to be similar to the previous one. Plastic type B appears to have stretched the farthest but it is impossible to tell seeing there are no starting lengths. The plastics as well as the weights should have been the exact same size.
-1	Pandas and koalas both have to stay in certain area of the world. For them to survive they need to eat food exclusive to their homeland. Pythons on the other hand can live in a variety of climates. The article states that they can be found in Asia and America.
-1	The pandas from China are similar to the Australian koalas because they survive on only one food source. Pandas only eat bamboo and the koala only eats eucalyptus leaves. But there are very different from the pythons because the python is a carnivore so it has a wide range of animals it can eat.
-1	One would need to find out witch sample is bigger and see how much big it is than the rest of them. Try to find out witch one can be is acid rain and not loss any mass and tell them you think this had happened in an if the because sentence.
-1	After reading the group's procedure, some good additional information would be what the containers are made of, the dependent variable, and the dependent variable.
1	In order to replicate this experiment,you must also know how much vinegar goes in each container, how the mass is being determined and where the containers should be put for the 24 hours( what type of climate).
-1	Additional information I would need in order to replicate the experiment would be the amount of vinegar you need to pour into the cups. What the samples you're using or and what your control group is going to be. There are important parts of the procedure that are missing.
-1	a. Plastics A and B and C are more stretch resistant than plastic B and D. Also plastic B stretched the most with 22mm the first trial and 23mm the second trial. ^p b. One ways they could of told us the IV, OV and the constants of the lab like why they are doing it.
1	Some additional information that i would need to know to replicate the experiment would be what are the different samples that are used, i would also need to know how much of the sample to weigh, so they are all equall. What type of container should the sample be put into? how should i determine the mass of the different samples? How much vinegar to pour into the samples?.
-1	a) The total amount of T2 is greater than T1. ^p b) All lengths should be the same and every step should be equal to the others.
1	A) My conclusion would be that plastic B stretched the most because it had the farthest length's both times. ^p B) They should have put weights to make the weight even on the other side. They should've also done more trials on the other types of wrap.
-1	Chinese Panda's and Koalas are similar because they both have exclusive diets like Panda's is bamboo and Koalas is eucalyptus leaves. They are different from pythons because pythons diet aren't exclusive they will eat a wood rat & alligator as said in the story.
-1	a) According to my results plastic type B had the greatest amount stretched with 22mm in trial one and in trial 2 with 23mm. I would rely on plastic type B to hold my things. ^p B) 1-st way the student's could have made theire results validity better one instead of putting plastic type A B C D they should have labeled them by what plastic they were. 2-nd the students should have seen how far the plastic could stretch before breaking.
1	In order to replicate the experiment, procedure should include the names of the four different samples, the amount of vinegar that should be poured in each cup, and the size of the four identical containers.
-1	To replicate the experiment, I would need the materials to replicate the procedure I would need to know how much vinegar to pour each of the containers .To replicate the experiment  would need to know where to place the containers with the vinegar and materials in it .
-1	On the groups procedure some additional information I would need in order to replicate this experiment would be is what sample and you start first what happens if nothings happens to the sample in 24 hours and how do you find the difference in mass.
-1	"Pandas and koalas are both specialists. They survive on thing thing (pandas bamboo, koalas leaves). While a python is a generalist who has multiple food sources and can live in many places. paragraph 21 is a good example ""A specialist is China's panda, which eats almost nothing but bamboo""."
-1	a. Tell how much vinegar you used. ^p b.
-1	Three pieces of information you need in order to replicate the experiment is a hypothesis first to predict what you think will happen. Secondly, you need the data information like what they did in the table and third you need your tools which they obviously had since they already recorded their data.
-1	To replicate this lab you would need the samples to be the same masses. Also the amount time you let the samples sit has to be the same, then you would have to remove the samples and completely clean them.
-1	You need the type of materials needed, the amount of materials in order to mix the samples and have steps in two different steps inorder to understand it.
-1	"Based on the data I believe that plastic ""B"" has the best stretchability and its strong. ^p The students could have added a trial 3 just so the experiment could be accurate and instead of cutting all the plastics yourself get precut so they all be the same size."
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both don't eat meat. They are both different from a python because they don't eat meat and a python does. The panda eats bamboo and the koala eats eucalyptus leaves. Python was seen trying to eat an alligator.
-1	Some additional information would be how much of each sample would be put into the vinegar. Also, maybe not have then sit for 24 hours, but hav then sit less. They could also have rinsed them with replica water instead of distilled water.
1	The additional information needed would be: the exact amount of vinegar that is poured into each cup. You would  also need to know a specific type of container to put the sample in. Lastly, you may need to know that the samples are marble, limestone, wood and plastic.
-1	My conclusion is that plastic type D stretched the farthest both trials. They could have done another trial and they could have put more weights on the clamp so it can stretch more.
1	(A) According to the students data. The conclusion I can draw is that plastic B had the most strechability it stretched 22 mm in trial one and 2mm in trial two second was plastic d it's strechability was 20mm for both trials and the least stretchabilty was plastic A with 10 in trial one and 12 in trial 2. (B) could have done more trials to compare data to and make trials to compare data to and make sure that each piece of diffrant plastics were the same size.
-1	Plastic type B was the most stretchable. It stretched on average 22.5 mm while the others did not stretch past 20 mm. The student could have improved the experiment as design by including the averages and using 3 trials instead of one. Also if one made all the plastics the same length. One could accurately determine which was the most stretchable.
-1	"Pandas in China & Koalas in Australia are similar because they both eat from a certain tree. They are different from pythons because pythons are more wild and eat different than koalas and pandas. "" A specialist is China's  panda, which eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australian...""."
-1	Additional information needed in order to replicate in experiment would be how much vinegar would be poured in the container. if you do too much it's or not put the same amount in each mass the experiment will be dried. Also naming the containers with each sample so you know what when you write down your data. Including record data would or additional information too because if it wasn't without a procedure someone might forget to write all the data down.
-1	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia they are both similar that eat plants and doesn't eat meat or human they are different to pythons that they are bears the pythons is a sneak and the python don't eat plants.
-1	After reading the groups procedure, the following additional information is needed, you need to observe the containers when you fill each with the content, you will need to make sure each container has the very same amount, then also make sure that all the containers are in the same room temp.
1	A conclusion I have drawn is that plastic type B is the best plastic in this experiment. I know this because the data shows that it had stretched the most compared to the other three plastics in five minutes. Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and the validity of the result would be in perform the experiment again and make sure the same weights are used. By performing the experiment again the data would be shown four times instead of two and for once accurate. By using the same weights, we would know that the plastics are stretched fully.
-1	Plastic type D has 19 better chance of having stretchability because during both trials the amount stretched out equal, so it has a accurate chance of stretching. The student could have improved this experimental design by adding another trial and reapeating the same procedure.
1	In order to replicate the experiment, i would need to know a saw things. i would need to know how much vinegar they used, what kind of containers and how big it is and what kind of vinegar was used.
-1	In conclusion in the 1st trial all of the plastics here higher. In the second trial plastic A increased by 2mm, plastic B increased by 1mm, plastic C increased by 1mm, and plastic D stayed the same. I believe the amount of plastic stretched in the second trial depends on the type of plastic.
1	Some additional information that would need in order to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar you need, the size of the containers used in the experiment. You would also need to know the temperature of which the experiment would be staying at in the 24 hour period.
1	a) After investigating how much each plastic type stretched, a conclusion has made that plastic type B stretched most than D, Than C and plastic type A stretched the least. b) Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design was to first use the same starting length of the plastic bag that could effect the results and secondly be more specific about how much weight to add.
-1	"China's panda and Australia's koala bear are both called ""specialists"" in the article ""One man's pet, Another's Invasive species"" by Joel Achenbach. They both have limited diets, mainly eating 1 food, for the panda it's bamboo and for the koala it's eucalyptus leaves. These animals differ from the python because it is called a ""generalist"" and the python is carnivorous and can eat anything."
-1	Some additional information that we would need to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar should be placed in each identical container, how or what tool to use to measure the mass of the four different samples and how much distilled water to use to rinse the four samples after taking them out of the vinegar.
1	a) From the data, I've seen, I can conclude that plastic type B stretched the most even though between both trials it only increased 1 mm, 22-23. But on the otherhand plastic type D only hit 20 and stayed 20, still being close to B. ^P b) I know two way that I could improve the experiment; first the student should say how long each plastic should be; second, the student should say how much weight is being put on each time.
-1	The similarity between panda bears from China and koala bears from Australia is the two species eat mainly one or a few things. Panda's eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus tree leaves. These animals differ from pythons because this harmful animal will eat anything that is meat, and can survive with the changes in its own diet.
-1	The pandas  in China are like the koalas in Australia because they are both specialist animals that can adapt to a specific environment and food sources. On the other hand they use both different from the generalist python who can really adapt to a new environment and change its diet easily.
-1	"Pandas and koalas are similar to each other because they are both specialist. Specialists are specific in what they eat, like the panda which eats almost nothing but bamboo "" and also like the koala which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively"".  These are both different from the pythons because it "" can live anywhere from Florida to Antarctica to  outer  space"". The conditions and food a python requires is much more compared to koalas/ pandas."
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia are both specialists. They eat almost nothing but one thing. They are different from pythons by how because pythons eat a lot more than just one thing, they eat a variety of things.
1	After reading the groups procedure, there are some things that may need to be added to be able to replicate the expirement. In the procedure, the students would have to add what the four samples are that are being used to determine the mass. Also, the students used to write down how much vinegar to put into each of the four containers. Last but not the least, the students will have to add what size should all four containers be for the samples.
1	Some additional information you would need would be the names of the four samples being used in the procedure, the amount of vinegar put in each cup and the size of the cups being used. You would also need to be told to determine the difference in mass.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both eat almost nothing but 1 thing,m for pandas:bamboo, koalas;eucalyptus leaves: so if they moved to a different environment they couldnt adapt/survive. They differ from pythons, because pythons could adapt and eat anything.
-1	a) I conclude that 12 has stretched more than 11. ^p b) Two ways the students could have improved the experiment design is by..1) they could have added the amount of weights they used. 2) They could have timed it.
1	a). Plastic D and plastic C are not that good. The two types that increased type A and B. ^p b). They should'nt have taped it to a table. There should have been 2 people holding it from both sides. Also I think they should have measured in inches.
-1	The information that is needed to replicate this experiment would be that firstly they need a hypothesis. Secondly, they need to list all objects they used, lastly they need to state weather their hypothesis was/wasn't correct.
-1	After reading the group's procedure,some additional information I would need to replicate the experiment would be: ^p                               1) To know the amount of vinegar they used ^p                               2) To know what their control variable is and their independent variables are since  they didn't label that ^p                               3) To Know whether or not the mass of the materials was with the mass of the container, because that will effect the results and decrease validity.
-1	In order for me to replicate this experiment I would have to know how I would determine the mass of each samples. When do you pour the vinegar in the containers. And what does distilled water mean.
-1	Some additional information they could have added was they they should have weighed the sample before they put 4 in the vinegar.
-1	To replicate the experiment I would need the data, the samples of the experiment and I would also need the equipment.
-1	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are very similar because they both mainly eat one thing that is abundant in their habitat. Pandas eat almost only bamboo which they can easily find in China wildlife koala bears mainly eat eucalyptus leaves, which is widely available to them in Australia. Pythons are different because they are carnivores and don't only thing on one thing. According to the article, pythons can eat anything from mice to alligator.
1	A) From the data I am draw the conclusion that polymer B had the most stretchability. Polymer plastic B stretch an average of 22.5mm which was greater than polymer A, C and D. ^P B). To improve this experiment, the students should make sure that the amount of weight put on each plastic sample to make sure that the type of plastic was the only variable involved. Also the students should run more trials to make sure that their results were valid. With more trials, the experiment will get more results and a better chance that they are accurate.
1	To replicate this experiment, the reader needs to know what kinds of samples to use, how much vinegar to use and what kinds of containers to use. The procedure is very vague. A scientist would need much more specific information in order to perform the experiment. Therefore the students should specify the marble, limestone, wood + plastic. They should also specify the amount of vinegar needed as well as the type of container that should be used.
-1	Why they are doing this exparament?  what the problem is how much vinagar is needed. What is the controll  for the experament ;
-1	"Pandas are similar to koalas because the both dont eat meat just leaves and trees. In the story it states ""A specialist is china's panda, which eats almost nothing but bamboo,.."" They are different from pythons because pythons eat meat and they dont eat plants and leaves."
1	One piece of information that would be necessary if replicating this experiment is how much vinegar was used. You would also need to know how much of each sample you would place in the cup. You might also want to know what size cup was used so that the person conducting the experiment could do if exactly the same. On other piece of information that would be helpful is knowing how long for use the saying so that each sample is getting the same amount of H.O applied.
1	Some additional information that they would need to include in order for someone to replicate their investigation, would be the amount of vinegar poured in each container, the size or amount of each sample needed & the type of containers to hold each sample in.
-1	After reading the group's procedure I would need to know what kind of samples was I supposed to got and how much I need to use for this investigation so I can replicate the experiment.
-1	"Pandas in china are similar to koalas in ways that they both really only eat are main thing ""A specialist in china.Panda which eats almost nothing but bamboo or Australia only bear which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively"".This quote from the article states those ways in which they're similar.There both different from a python are eaters mostly and pandas a  koalas are organised consumers."
1	In order to replicate the lab, the students did you would need to know what materials were need. What kind of area are you going to do the lab in and how much vinegar you need to pour into the samples.
-1	According to the article pandas in china are alike to koalas in Australia because there food source can be found in only one part of the world so they live in that part only unless in captivity. There specialist while pythons are generalist meaning they can survive in many different parts of the world not just one place.
-1	Hypothesis to take a guess  wether the mass of four samples 1 of they was going to be right. ^p Independent  dependent variables in the students experiment ^p Results - The would didn't have any difference in mass and had the starting and ending mass were were the same 11.2
-1	Chinas pandas and Australia's koala bears are similar because they each only eat one kind of food that it. The phython can eat anything pretty much. Thats how the phython is different from the pandas and koala. The koala eats eucalyptus leaves and pandas eat only bamboo.
-1	The first bit of information that you need is how  vinegar is needed in the four different containers. They never said what to use to determine the mass and they never said what kind of samples.
-1	a) Plastic type D seems to be more accurate of stretchability because after both trials T1 and T2 the amount stretched is the same at 20 mm. ^P b) One the experiment could be proved is to repeat the experiment. A second way is to make an hypothesis before starting the experiment.
-1	You will need a solution, results and a conclusion.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both rely on only a certain type of food and can only survive in their natural habitat where that food is available. They are both different from pythons, because unlike pandas & koalas, pythons can survive in many different environments and they are not picky when it comes to eating.
-1	Panda  and koalas are similar because they're both specialists and they both eat pretty much only one type of plant. They are both different from pythons because pythons are generalists, so they will eat almost anything; also pythons are invasive and pandas are koalas are not.
-1	Well first thing they do was they determine the mass of the samples, they Vinegar on different samples and than they wash it with water.
-1	After reading the groups procedure, I think they should have added record the data, get materials, observe the expariment and repeat expariment.
-1	Pandas are similar to koalas because both of them are specialists. They both need to eat a certain type of food to live. They are different form pythons because pythons are generalists that eat anything they can so they can thrive anywhere.
-1	Pandas and koalas are similar because they both live in specific areas. Pandas need what is provided in China and koalas need what is in Australia. Pythons differ, however because they can adapt anywhere with similar climats, for example Asia and the US.
-1	Two ways that the students could have improved the expirement design or validity of the results is by increasing the amount of times they stretched the plastic and the plastic type could get changed.
-1	Chinese pandas and Australian koala bears are similar because they are specialists. According to the article, they each eat almost exclusively one type of plant and can survive where those plants grow. Pythons are different because they are generalists, and can survive in many different areas because they have a wide variety of food sources.
-1	As the author said towards the end of the article both of these are specialist animals who need to remain in one area to eat the food they are accustomed to. This would not allow these species to be invasive. This is much different to the pythons because that species can adapt any change to the environment around them, unlike the specialists which do very little change.
-1	Pandas in china are similar to koalas in Australia because they feed off of specific food, such as bamboo and eucalyptus. While pythons can be accustomed to cadira different variediles of animals. A python is invasive but has only one special need, which is habitat.
1	Based on the results of the experiment, plastic type B had the least overall stretch. Although the groups results are not valid. There are two ways to improve the experiment in an experiment, you should always construct 3 trials to validate your results also, all of the samples should be exactly the same length.
-1	Don't know.
1	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to have to add some steps. A few steps that were missing would be the amount of vinegar poured in each cup, how long to rinse the distilled water and also where to let these samples dry off at.
-1	You would to add the labels again. Then you would have to record your results yet again and then you would check you work.
-1	Pandas are similar to Koalas because they're both bears, they don't each much, they don't do nothing, etc. They're both different from pythons because pythons are dangerous they would eat anything, also they are faster than pandas and koalas.
-1	You would need to add how much vinegar is needed to be poured in the container. I think the students should have started out with the same mass. What type of vinegar and does temperature matters.
-1	To be able to replicate the expariment, you would need to know the 4 samples you are exparimenting with. Although the 4 samples are listed in the data shown below the procedure, it doesn't show the samples in the procedure and if I was to do the expariment without the other groups data, there is no way I could without knowing the samples.
-1	A. Plastic type D is the p
-1	You need a mearing cup the mearer the mass of energy. Then we get plastic of starting mass.
-1	Based on the following data on the polymer investigation, I can make a conclusion that the plastic D type is the most stretchy. Also the trials very similar but only average by 12 mm because the stretchyness. either increased or decreased. If a student were to complete this experiment all over again I would suggest that they change the way they set up the experiment because it was very complicated which leads to many errors. The students should also test the experiment 2 more times to see a range of results.
1	To replicate this experiment one must know information that is not given by the procedure. First, we must know how much vinegar to put into the containers, enough to cover them? Next, we need to know how the vinegar will affect the material. Will  we completely submerge it or only partially? Finally, we need to know which materials to use. The data indicates them, but the procedure does not.
-1	3.a) The plastics A +b stretched farther the 2nd time but d+c stayed the same or went down. ^p B) Stretched it a third time or measure it when it was hanging off the table.
-1	The article said china's panda eats nothing but bamboo and Australia's Koalas bear eat eucalyptus leaves mainly one of their similar thing is rat leaves and whether cold or warm. Also, panda and Koala should in kind of bear. Their food tree are different but living nature is similar.
1	Osmosis makes water go into or leave the cell. Active transport is when the cell uses energy to bring something into it or make it leave. Passive transport is when theres more of something in the cell than there is outside of it, and so some leave the cell to create equilibrium, or vice versa.
-1	Well they all got diffient number of there project cause of the marbal got 9.8 limestone got 10.4 and wood 11.2 plastic 7.2 for the starting mass -5 project.
-1	The similarity between pandas in China and koalas in Australia is that they are a specialists, they for example only eat a certain type of food. While generalists adapt and can eat multiple types of food. Both of these animals are different to pythons is because they can not live without bamboo or eucalyptus leaves, while pythons can eat anything.
-1	"Well the ""T2"" was higher except for ""C"" ^p The student could have told us how much time we have in between before we check again."
1	In order to replicate this experiment you need to know the mass for each sample if it's the same or not, you also need to know the amount of vinegar and the size of the containers. The given procedure doesn't tell the location so you need to know the location of the containers.
-1	After reading the recorded data from the investigation I can conclude that out of plastics A,B,C, and D plastic A and B both increased in milemeters opposed to C which decreased after the second trial while plastic D stayed the same during both trials. One way the student could have improved the experimental design would be by leaving the the clamps on the plastic for longer that 5 minutes, another would be to perform  a third trial.
-1	Pandas and koalas are specialist species. They both eat one particular thing. Pandas eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves without these food source these two animals will not be able to survive. koalas and pandas are different from pythons because pythons are generalist species. They eat anything from large animals to small, birds other reptiles, etc. They can survive anywhere.
1	When translation begins, the mRNA goes with a ribosome and attaches itself to a start codon. It then goes with a ribosome to start adding the anticodons to the codons added on to the genetic code; the anticodons are added by the tRNA. The tRNA attaches to the P site first then moves to the A site when the it attaches an amino acid to the amino acid chain, then this process continues until a stop codon is reached. The result is the newly created protein.
1	Plastic type B has more stretchability then plastics A,C or D. Plastic B stretched on average of 22.5mm whereas A averaged it, C averaged 13.5 and D averaged 20. The students should have specified the weight added and used that weight each time. The students should also have started with the same size plastic and specified that length.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalasa in Australia because they both are specialists. Also they only eat one thing. For example pandas only eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves. They are different because they eat different things. In the article it says panda eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves.
-1	"The conclusion is plastic type have 10 and 12 amounts stretched. The two ways the students ""Take  a sample of one type of plastic, and measure its length, and add weight to the clamp and allow them to hang for five minutes."
1	One piece of information i would need is the amount of vinegar to pour into the containers. A second piece is to know samples of what the first step says 4 samples but can they be anything? Lastly, i need to know if it matters where i leave my experiment. I should know if it needs to be in hot or cold temperatures or if it needs sunlight and factors like that.
1	How much vinegar you pour into the cups. What kind of vinegar you use.What kind of containers you should use.
-1	A conclusion based on the student's data is that plastic type D was stretched the most. Two ways that the student could have improved the experimental design would be to vary the weights and amounts placed on the plastic, and to vary the time for  the trials.
-1	According to the data table the conclusion of this experiment would be that plastic type B stretched the most in both trials 1 and trials 2. ^p Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design or validity of the results was to try different amounts of weights that get attached to each plastic and also to let the plastic hang for different amounts of time to see the affect it would have.
-1	The conclusion is that in trials the student conducted it seems that in T2, the plastic stretched more than trial one. The student could change the experiment by telling you how much weight she put on each clamp. She could have taken away the second trial.
-1	Out of all the polmer plastics type A stretched a total of 2 mm as the best one. ^p To have a control and to make sure to tell us how long the plastic is.
-1	Additional information I would need to replicate the experiment is to whether I should leave the samples in a dark or lighted area for the 24 hour time period. Also I would need to know if I should leave the samples at room temperature or a cooler area. I would also need to know how much vinegar 3 should use, it doesn't state it clearly.
-1	A. To conclude, polymer plastic B has the higest strech in meters. ^P B. Add different weights. ^P See which is more durable or stonger. ^P Clamp each differently.
-1	a) Plastic type B was the most stretchable plastic used because it was stretched longer than any other plastic in both trials. Plastic  type A had the least stretchability with 10mm for the first trial and 12mm for the second. ^p The student could have improved his/her experiment by keeping these two variables constant would make the experiment very reliable.
1	(A) I think that the plastic type A was the strongest because it stretched down the least. Plastic type B was least strongest because it went down the most. ^p (B) The student could included more trials to add validity. The student could have also included how much weight was being added to the plastic.
-1	In order to replicate the experiment, you would need four samples. The sample materials should be marble, limestone, wood, and plastic. Also, you would need vinegar, to pour into the containers which hold the four different samples. Additionally, distilled water needs to be used to rinse the materials, four different containers to hold the samples, and a triple beam balance to measure the starting and ending mass of the samples.
-1	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar you put into each sample. You would also need to measure them at the exact time because the one you measure last might grow a little more because it was sitting longer.
-1	"Both China pandas and Australia's koalas are similar because they harmful and require less work "" A specialist is China's panda which eats almost nothing but bamboo, Which eats eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively."" This shows they require little effort to have while pythons are dangerous and cost all this money like memory chip and a permit."
-1	The panda and the koala bear are both specialists so they only eat one thing and nothing else. The python will eat a variable of things and is a generalists.
-1	"Out of all the four plastics, type B stretched the most. One way the student could have improved was to mention that there are four types of plastics rather than are in, step one. Another way the student could have improved was to make his/her data table more clear and accurate by adding a ""time attached"" column."
-1	"Panda in china are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialist.A s the story says. ""A specialist is china's panda or Australia koalas bear. They are both different from python because a python is a generalist pythons can live almost any where.Pandas and koalas bear can only live in certain areas."
-1	While I would need to know how much to put in each container and were to put these items from, and the fact were this could be done at in or out doors. How to get the starters mass of each sample. Between the starters and ending of the investigation how many times do you check it.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to that of koalas in Australia because they are both specialists, They are both bears, and they both have a food of  than choice that they eat nonstop. They are both different from pythons because  a python is a generalists and they are specialists and pythons are considered a danger, pandas and koalas are not.
-1	China's pandas are similar to koalas in Australia because they both pretty much only eat one thing or one type of plant. Panda eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves. On the other hand, they both are different from python because pythons are carnivorous and can eat other wildlife, and don't eat just one thing.
-1	By looking at the results, one can see that plastic type B and D stretched almost twice as much as the other two types. This shows us that B and D are most likely low density polymers because of their flexibility. A and C however are not as flexible and therefore are high density polymers. The experiment could have been improved by adding another plastic type or running more trials. The weights could have been changed also to test the strength.
-1	a) Based on the students data, I conclude that plastic type A was the least stretched out and that plastic type B was the most. ^p b) Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results is by one, keeping the amount of weight added to each type of plastic constant and two, making sure that the weight of the clamp was subtracted.
1	You would need the specific amount of vinegar used for the experiment to replicate it. You would also need to know what the specific samples were and the volume of the containers so that the experiment sould be replicated.
-1	In order for you to replicate this experiment you need to know how much of the material they put in each cup. How much water you need and the amount of vinegar.
-1	What was their prediction before they start. After check if their prediction was right or not.
-1	To replicate this experiment the following information is needed, the amount of vinger that is needed in this experiment should be given. In this experiment to much or to little virner may be used. There should as be multible trails because the different samples may or may not take any vinger in. And the labeling  may not be the right label. The experiment should tell what each container should be labeled with.
-1	The students left out some important information in the procedure, like how much vinegar should be put into the cups. If we were to replicate the experiment we would not have the students data table so how much of what samples do we need to conduct the experiment. Where should the samples dry, warm, cold, in the sun?
-1	To replicate the experiment, they would need to tell you how much vinnegar to put in the cups, have all the rocks way the same and tell us why they are doing the experiment.
-1	One thing I would need to know is how much vinegar they poured into each container. Also I would also need to know how long I would rinse the material off far. Finally I would a need to find out what they used to dry or did they leave it on the table.
1	How much vinegar would you pour in each cup. What temperature would the samples be in,would it be the same or would it be different? how would also need to know if they used the same size cup. These things are all very important information that wasn't included.
-1	Pandas and koalas are different from pythons because they are specialists. Pandas almost exclusively eat bamboo, while koalas almost exclusively eats eucalyptus leaves. This means that these animals are really only able to live in certain areas, while the generalist python can feed on countless foods and can deal with a fairly large range of temperatures.
-1	A . A conclusion based on the students data is that the stronger the plastic that they use is the harder it is to stretch . For example sample A and C must be thicker because it stretched less. ^p B, Two ways the students could have improved the experiment was by actually putting the same amount of weight on each and by saying the names.
-1	Panda's are similar to koala's because they are both specialists and a python is a generalist.
-1	You need to repeat the the experiment 2 more time, record all data then compare them to see of samples have any change. Also backround information is important to any experiment.
1	To replicate the experiment the amount of vinegar would need to be known to keep the experiment a constant. The containers that the materials are put into would also will have to be the same size to keep everything the same. The materials would have to be rinsed with the same distilled water and set to dry in the same temperature environment.
-1	You would need to add observations, you would also need to add the time on the table.
-1	You would need to write down in the procedure to record the starting mass and the ending mass. You would also need to record the time that the samples were being listed.Last is how would need to determine what kind of container the samples was being shown in.
1	The students need to say what  the samples are. They need to
-1	"Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both only eat one thing from their country. "" China's panda, which eats nothing but bamboo, or Australia,s koala bear, which eats eucalyptus leaves"". (p 21) They are both different from pythons because the python is a generalist and the panda & koala are specialists."
-1	"Koalas bears and Panda bears are similar because they are both specialist. ""A specialist is China's Panda, which eats nothing but bamboo or Australia's Koala bear"". Being specialist makes them different from pythons because pythons are generalist species."
-1	Pandas from China and koalas are similar because they stay mostly in the same place and eat the same thing. They are different from pythons because pythons move around all over the world and will eat basically anything.
-1	Maybe put more mass in the wood and leve it in longer than 24 years and period in for 10 mins.
1	a.) Plastic type A is stronger and stretches less/ slowest then C,D, and B. ^p b.) Make each plastic the same starting lenth, and the weights are the same weight.
-1	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they are both specialist species. They both require specific resources and climate to survive. These limits them to only their natural habitats. This makes pandas and koalas much different than pythons. Pythons are generalists and can survive in many different places. That is why pythons are being found naturally in Florida but not koalas or pandas.
1	A) From the table shown you can conclude that plastic type B in this investigation could stretch the farthest meaning it is the strongest of all the dffent types because it stretched 22mm and 23mm. ^P B) 1) Could have said how much weight to start with each time putting diffent stress levels on the plastics. 2) Told how long to keep the weight on beforeadding on more because this could cause a change in strength or stretchability.
-1	The students would also need to keep recording every thing they see.
1	In conclusion, plastic type B stretched the most in both trials. ^p One way the student could have improved the validity is to cut each plastic to the same length. Another way to improve the experiment design is to specify how much weight to add to the clamp.
-1	Pandas are similar to koalas because they are both specialists. For example bamboo is to pandas as eucalyptus leaves is to koalas. These two species are different from snakes since a snake is a generalist species. Snakes are generalists because they can adapt to many different locations where as pandas are stuck on China and koalas are in Australia.
1	a) My conclusion based on the students data is that plastic type B is the most stretchable because for both trials it stretched more than all the other plastic types. b) Two ways the student could have improved the design could be to specify how many weights they added to the clamp and they could of also used something sturdier stronger to hold down the plastic so it wouldn't come off the table.
-1	In order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar to put into the containers.
-1	The mass of four different samples. ^p The time for them to sit. ^p The purpose of the experiment and wich sample. ^p Distilled water better.
-1	Based on the student's data I can conclude that plastic type D is the strongest of them all, for both trials 1 and 2. I think they could have explained it more so that I could have a better mental image of it. I also think they should have said how much weight they added the the clamps.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to Koalas in Australia because they are the most Known animal that lives there when you think of these two countries the Panda and Koala are the 2 animals that come to mind. Also they rely on one thing to eat while python eats several different things and live in different parts of the world. Pandas and Koalas are not cold blooded as well, unlike pythons.
-1	In order to replicate this experiment, we would need to know how much vinegar to put in the containers. We also would need to know how they plan to measure the mass of each sample. Another thing we would need to know before we could replicate this experiment, what the hypothesis is.
-1	The students data needed to include how much of the solution was poored. They also needed to find out if the rocks weighed the same when they started.
-1	Two ways could have been improved is by doing group and they needed a hypothesis to know wether their question was right or wrong s conclusion is the plastic type A and D there used because they might have putten more weights on different types for the second trial.
-1	Pandas and koalas are similar because they are specialists. Pandas only eat bamboo and koalas only eat eucalyptus leaves. But pythons will eat anything. One time a python tried to eat an alligator whole which is something a panda or koala would never do.
-1	Plastic type (A) stretched (2in) and plastic type (D) it didn't stretched at all.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia and are different from pythons because the pandas and koalas are specialist, but the pythons are generalist. An example from the article states ''a python can live anywhere. China's panda, which eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's koala bear which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively.'' This shows that the python is different because it can live anywhere but not the panda and koala.
-1	Panda in China are similar to koalas in Australia both these animals are mostly vegiterian which means they mostly eat vegitation. The pand mostly eats bamboo and the koalas eat eucalyptus  leaves almost exclusively. But on the other hand the pythons eat every thing in the article is states a python swallowed a alligator. Thats the diferants between pandas/koalas and pythons.
-1	Limestone has the highest starting mass then come wood, marble, and plastic so this investigation is complete.
-1	In conclusion, plastic type D stretched the most out of the samples. Plastic A, on the other hand, was the least stretchable.^p The student could've specified the types of plastics they were testing. They also should have specified the amount of weight they were adding to the clamp. They didn't say how to measure the length of the plastic types.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they almost eat just one kind of food all the time. They are different to pythons because they don't migrate and they don't eat animals and pythons do.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists, but both are different from pythons because they are generalists. Pandas and Koalas rely exclusively on only one food source to survive. Pandas eat bamboo and Koalas eat eucalyptus. Pythons can survive in region that have climate conditions similar than those of their homeland.
-1	Pandas in china  and koalas in Australia are both similar because they both feed off of the load such as bamboo or eucalyptus leaves.Both pandas and koalas are similar because they share the difference.From pythons pandas and koalas bears are different from pythons because pandas and koalas can only live in one place while the python, a generalist can live anywhere .
-1	Well in this data I can conclude that the amount stretched from trial one has increased when they did the second trial, but plastic D stood the same which was at 20. ^p The student could have made this experiment better by telling us what type of plastics they used. Also they could have said how much the weights, weighed.
-1	Take an hypothesis of what masses they'll have, analyze your results and make a conclusion to the problem.
1	a. Overall plastic type b had the most stretchability amongst all of them.^p b.1  done more trials to compare with results. b2 check lengths and other measurements to see if they are correct.
-1	One thing you would need to know to replicate the experiment is what the temp of the vinegar was because that can affect your results. Another thing you wouldneed toknowis how much vinegar was put into each container because that could also change the results. The last thing you would need to know is what they weighed the objects on because if you use another type of scale it could change your results.
1	According to the data table it looks like the plastic type B was stretched the most and plastic A was stretched the best. B. One way the experiment could have improved is if they said what the measurement of the plastic was before the weights were on it. Another thing is they have said how much the weight was that hung on the plastic.
-1	To replicate this experiment I would need to know how much vinegar to put in each sample. I would also need to know what the control of the experiment was so I could compare results of the samples. Lastly I would need to know if the experiment was completed.
-1	The pandas and the Koala bear are alike because they aren't eating people or other animals. Pandas eat bamboo and Koalas eat eucalyptus leaves, they are also alike because they are specialist. Pandas and Koalas are different from pythons because a python is a generalist and pythons are viewed as a threat to society they are dangerous and eat other animals and possibly humans.
-1	Well the article states that China's panda which eats nothing but bamboo's and the Australia's koala bear which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively and the similarity them is that they eat mostly one type of food source even the it might be different.
-1	Pandas and koalas are both similar because they are both specialist species. They both thrive of their tough environment by eating one type of food. They are both different from the python because has multiple food sources when the koala and panda only eat one type of plant.
-1	"Pandas and koalas are similar because they eat only a specific plant and their not meat eaters. Their different from  pythons because pythons eat meat not leaves I know this because to the story it said ""panda bear eat bamboo and Koalas eat eucalyptus leaves."
1	Osmosis is where water helps move things in and out of the cell. Active transport is when energy is used to move the substances across the cell membrane.Passive transport is when energy is not used to move the substances across the cell membrane.
-1	The plastic from T2 stretched a little more than it did in T1. They could have made sure the plastic weights the same, and the could of made sure the weights were all equal in each group.
-1	a) Based on the data, plastic type B stretched the most during trial 1 and trial 2, the least stretchable plastic was plastic type A. Type C was not very stretchable, and plastic D was the second most flexible. ^p To ensure accuracy of the experiment. ^p The student could have revealed the weight added to each plastic in the table, to make sure that it was constant and also could have measured after a longer amount of time.
-1	A specialist is China's panda, which eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's koala bear, which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively.
-1	50% of the plastics stretched farther & the second time, 25& did worse the second time and a 5% did the same. ^p A third trial might help and explain what the if plastics were.
1	A. Plastic type A stretched the least out of the others in both trials. Plastic type is stretches the most in both trials. The student did not have a control variable.^P The student could have measured each plastic before adding weights to make a controll each plastic type had to be the same length. Could have done more trials to make the experement more valid
1	Additional information needed to replicate this experiment would be to give the samples and how much of the samples were used in the procedure. Also the amount of vinegar and the size of the container used should be given.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists. They both have stability like only eating bamboo or eucalyptus trees. They are both different from pythons because pythons are generalists and they favor change but as previously stated specialists favor stability.
-1	Both pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar by the way that they both eat naturally growth vegestables like bamboo or eucalyptus plants; Yet they both differ from pythons because while they eat plants, the pythons consumes animals like wond rats- even alligators.
1	To replicate the experiment you would need several more pieces of information. Firstly the amount of vinegar added would need to be included to try and control additionals for every material. Secondly you would need to know where the containers would be left for 24 hours after pouring vinegar. Different environments could affect the date. Third, you would need to know what type of container to use for the whole experiment. Differences in volume in different containers would also affect the data.
-1	You would need at least  4 containners, some vine-gar and label stickers. Also you will might need is a watch to record your time of the mass.
-1	Your going to need how much is there in total.
-1	Additional information that should be added and to be started with is a breif introduction of the experiment and the purpose of it. What kinds of mass, should be added in so that can cause confusion. The way I know , what were tha masses was the students data that was recorded. The procedure should also state exactly what neeeds to be recorded like starting and ending mass and the difference in mass.
-1	a) When the experiment was finnish the data showed that the four different polymer plastics for stretchability didn't have different results. The amount the four plastic types stretched in test one and test two were almost the same. ^p b) Two differnt ways the student could have improved the experimental design and validity would of bein adding time for the weight to work.
-1	"Koalas and pandas are both specialists and they eat nothing but one thing and they wouldn't be able to adapt anywhere else. Unlike koalas and pandas, the python can adapt to almost anywhere like a human, ""a human breing who with the assistance of technology can live anywhere from Florida to antarctica to outerspace."" A snake is a generalist just like a human."
1	First you would need to know what the samples are that they are talking about. Next you would need to know how much Vinegar you need to put in each container. you could also need to how long you should rinse each sample.
-1	They way pandas in China to koalas in Australia is that they both herbavors that eat plants and not meat. They the way they both are different than pythons is that pythons can and have easily adapted somewhere else and have turned into carnivors.
-1	"The first thing they should have done would be to change the first thing i.e the procedure to ""gather materials"". This lets people know what materials your using. Also, this procedure wasn't worded clearly. Like 2 ""pour vinegar into 4 separate but indentical containers"". That makes no sense and is hard to understand. They also never tell you how they got the mass of the samples."
-1	For plastic tube A and b the amount stretched went up a point. For plastic tube c it went down a pont and for D the plastic stretched stayed the same. ^P They could of improved by letting the plastic sit for a min.
1	A) Plastic type B was the most stretchy and stretched the longest during the given time. ^p B) The way the students could of improved was they could of conducted more trials to improve the validity of the results also in their procedure they could of said to make sure each polymer plastic was measured out before the experiment so they all start at the same length.
-1	The additional information I would need is to come up with an hypothesis to predict which sample will have the highest mass in acid rain. After that I will have to come up with my dependent and independent variables so I can tell and see each one is different in mass. I will organize the data to see if the information is accurate. Then I will write the conclusion to see if my hypothesis was correct and to see if my results were correct.
-1	First, the students should have specified what four samples to use in the first step. In step 3, the students should have told the reader that the samples were to be placed in the containers containing the vinegar. Also, it would have been a good idea to have included a step at the phd in which they would have to repeat the lab for accuracy.
-1	The article states that both pandas in china and koalas in Africa are similar. They are both specialists. However, the article also states that pythons are generalist and can pretty much live anywhere in the world. Pandas and koalas need specific food and a specific climate in order to survive.
-1	"As the article states in paragraph 21, ""pandas and koalas are both specialists""(pg5). Pythons are the opposite, generalists. A specialist; biologically speaking is an organism that has a set food source that they hardly hardly stray from. Generalists like pythons and ""arguably human beings ""(pg5) are organisms that have a variety in their diet. These organisms can adapt overtime to change what they eat. Specialists however will not."
-1	A) That depending on the plastic type depends weather the plastic stretch or not and how much. ^p B) One way put the first length then the second on the chart another way titled the plastic types.
1	a) The stretchiest kind of plastic was type B. because it stretched the most.^p ^p b) The student could have given the weights and the original length of the plastic in the procedure and made sure they were constant.
1	a. According to the student's data, plastic type B is the most flexible of the 4 plastic types. ^P b. First, the students could have used a specific length for each plastic strip to begin with, because they will most likely stretch more if they are longer to begin with. Second, they should make sure that they add the same weight for each trial and plastic, because they are measuring chevibility, not how much weight each can hold.
-1	With step number two how much vinegar should you pour? ^p With step number three what sample  goes with what container?
1	In conclusion plastic type B has the highest stretchability while type A has the lowest. One way that the student could have improved the experiment would be to have a specific weight such as 1 1b, 2 1b, 3 1b. Another way would be to add one more trial so as to prove or show better more valid results.
1	a) In conclusion, plastic type B was stretched the farthest for both trials, and plastic type A had the least amount of stretching. ^p b) The students could have improved their experiment's by adding more trials and tell us the specific amount of weight used for each plastic.
-1	Some additional information thats needed in this experiment, acid rain would be explang more in detail about how to use the steps, ow also should explain what each material is and lastly explain what sample means in differc! ways. This experiment snoch be more cleares and you should include a graish. This experiment doesnt make a whole lot of sene filvel.
-1	China's panda and Australia's koala are specialist and only really eat one type of food. Pythons are generalists and have a diet of many different things. The age we live in today favours generalists like the python.
1	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know which types of samples to begin with (marble,limestone,wood,plastic). You would also need to know exactly how much vinegar to pour in the containers for step 2, and lastly, what unit of measurement should the mass be recorded in?
1	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. You would need to know how long to rinse each sample with distilled water and using how much water. You would also need to know how they determined the masses of the samples both in the beginning and end of the experiment, and they exact size of the containers that the samples are being placed in.
1	I can conclude that plastic type A is a stronger plastic that it not very good a streching. I would add how much weight to put on the clamps and put in a 3rd trial.
1	According to the data, plastic type B is the stretchiest plastic. It stretched 22mm in trial one, and 23 mm in trial 2. ^p One way the students could have improved the validity of the experiment would be to not just add weights to the plastic like in the procedure, but put the same amount of weight on the plastic each time. Another problem would be if the plastic wasn't taped at the same distance from the edge and if they are using a new set of the same plastic for their second trial.
-1	Pandas and koalas are similar because they are both specialists which means that they have to have a certain food source and habitat. This differ from pythons because they are generalists and can eat anything and adapt almost everywhere.
-1	I would need to know how
-1	To exactly replicate this experiment you would have to know, how they measured the mass of the object, because without that how would we figure out the different masses. We have to know the starting mass, the ending mass and the difference in mass.
-1	These students should say what the sample's were that they used. For example they could say for step one that you obtained a marble, limestone, piece of wood and a piece of plastic. I would need the four sample's inorder to complete this task. Secondly I would need vinegar in four separate containers. Lastly I need distilled water for the sample's and I would need a weight measure to check the mass of all four or any samples.
1	The results from the students polymer lab show that plastic type B stretched furthest in both that's then any other material. The students could have improved the experiment by telling how much weight to add to each same and by telling how to specifically add them, I.F. shortly or by just dropping the weights on the clamp. As always more trials will increase the validity of any results in a science lab.
-1	"Pandas in China are similar to koalas because the both only eat plants. ""A specialist is China's panda witch eats almost nothing but bamboo or Australia's koala hear which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively."" There different from pythons because the eat rats and pandas and koalas don't."
-1	Plastic D didn't change and plastic A stretched more in trial 2. Basically most of the plastics change but not all of them. ^p One way is making each plastic the same length before the experiment. A second way is use the same amount of tape for each plastic type.
-1	They both are homnivores, but are mammals.
-1	Based on the data  shown, plastic type 'D' seems to be the most durable. The table shows that it did not stretch. The student could have improved validity by doing more trials, and repeating the experiment more than once incase any error wes made during the first run through of the test.
-1	1) Gather materials. ^p 2) Pour 20 ml vinegar in each of four separate out idenical containers. ^p 3) Place a samora of the material into the container and label. Reapent with remaining placing a striges sample into a single container. ^p 4) After 24hrs remove the sample from the containers and rines each sample with distilled water. ^p 5) Allow the sample to sit and dry for 50 mins. ^p 6) Determines the mass of each. ^p 7) Clean up where you worked.
-1	Pandas of China are like koalas in Australia because they both are very reliant on one source for food, bamboo for pandas and eucalyptus leaves for koalas. Pythons in contrast, and eat a variety of things which makes it a generalist, while pandas and koalas are specialist.
-1	Panda's in china are similar to koalas in Australia they only eat one type of food and don't cause a threat. unlike the phythons who eat many things and people are scared of them.
-1	I would still want to know what they were doing this experiment, how large were the samples and what was used to measure the work samples.
1	Based on the student's data you can draw a conclusion that plastic type B stretched the farthest amount. One way the student could have improved the experimental design would be by adding more trials. Another way would be by controlling the measurement of the plastic and weights so each are the same.
-1	I'll make sure that when I'm going to end the mass,I will remember to not add a later any chemical or anything else to the ending mass,so it won't turn out to be a negetive or a zero as the disposure in the mass.
-1	Pandas And koalas are both similar because they both eat plants exclusively. The pandas and koalas are both different from pythons because a python is a generalist and can live anywhere pandas and koalas are specialists which leaves exclusively.
-1	In order to replicate the experiment the reader would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers. You would also need to know if the starting mass for each sample should be the same. Finally, you would need to know how and where to store the samples during the 24 hours.
-1	Before weighing starting mass weigh each container alone then with the samples.
-1	You will need to know which rock had the most mass, which one had the least and which one was the same.
-1	According to the data that the students recorded, the starting mass had higher levels  the ending had some other high and low levels and the difference on mass had some law numbers out an order to replicate the experience I would  never backround hypothesis graft, counclution, problem, materials I think that what i will need in order to replicate the experiment.
-1	2.)At the end of the experiment i have concluded that plastic B had the best stretchability because in 1 and 2 it reached 22 mm the first time and 23 mm the second time. My hypothesis was also wrong because I had predicted plastic A would have the most stretchability but it didn't.^p (b)1.Put something heavier then weights. (2)Attach something other then a clamp.
-1	"Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar in that they're both specialist species. Both are specific on food source and climate and would have trouble adapting anywhere    else but there native habitat, unlike generalists. ""A generalist is a raccoon, a python, cockroach, white tailed dear....they can live anywhere from Florida to Antarctica.."" (paragraph 21)."
-1	"Pandas from China and koalas from Australia are very similar because they are both specialists, and they limit their food in take to one source. As stated in the article the Chinese panda ""eats almost nothing but bamboo"" and the Australian koala bear ""eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. Because of this they are limited to specific regions, which is different from the python which eats everything from rat to alligators."
1	It can be recorded that above all others tested in the experiment, plastic type B is the most stretchable. This is because at 22.5mm it had the largest amount stretched, on average between the two trails or all other plastic types. ^p Two ways this experiment can be improved is to state the amount of weight used foeach trial, with different weights being used, results could have different from what they should have been. Also, because the amount stretched is measured in such small increments (millimeters) more trials should be performed to enhance the data's accuracy.
1	To repeat this experiment, you would need a list of materials.
-1	Some of the additional information that will be needed is how much vinegar will be poured in the containers also will need four containers a balance bean to weight it and the samples.
-1	"Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialist. ""A specialist is China's panda, which eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's koala bear, which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively"". They both rely on specific food sources that are found only in certain areas. This differs from the pythons who can thrive in many different environments and have a more varied diet."
-1	China's panda is similar to Australias koala because these two animals are specialist species. These two specific place and only eat one specific food; compared to a python which is a generalist species that can adapt to other ranges throughout the U.S and eat a variety of different foods.
1	After reading the procedure i would  first need to know what the for sample are that i am testing second i ^p would need to know how much vinegar put in each container next the procedure should tell me how thing to case rinse each sample in distiled water.
1	Based on the students data, I can conclude that plastic type B was the most strechable of the four plastics because in T1 it streched 22 mm and in T2 it streched 23 mm. One ways the student could have improved the validity of their results would be to do more trials. One way they could have improved the experimental design would be by specifying the amount of weights to place on the clamps in step 4.
-1	1. One thing that could be added to the procceger is that you could try using another liquid, rather than viniger. 2. another thing that you could change is add two of each type so there would be 2 stone types, 2 plastics, and 2 woods. 3. instead of rinsing each sample after 24 hours you could messure the mass with the viniger and then rins it off and measure without the viniger.
-1	Pandas and koalas are similar because they only eat about one thing lik pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo and the koalas eats only eucalyptus leaves only. The pyth on eats anything it canget lik on alagator.
-1	How much vinager should you pour, with what label, and when to sit it, it sitand dry for 30 min...Label. The container's reapetedly, separate but identicle conatainer. What containers should we use?
1	First things i would need to know would be how much vinegar to pour into each containers. Another thing that may or may not be a determining factor in this experiment would be the each temperature and the temperature of the vinegar. Lastly, i would need to know which samples increased because i could have different samples than them.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to Australian Koalas because they both dont eat bamboo they are different from pythons because they don't eat alligators.
-1	Panda's in China feed mainly on bamboo. Koalas in Australia feed only on eucalyptus. These two species are similar because they both feed on mainly one prey, in this case plant. Pandas and koalas are different from pythons because pythons feed on other living organisms. They also have a wide range of prey from small organisms to sometimes even alligators.
1	Diffusion which is the processes of moving materals in and out of the cell, osmosis which is the procsess of water moving in and out of the cell, and fermentation which controls the proteins coming in and out of the cell
-1	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they eat the same food all the time, there specialist. There both different from a pythons because a python eats a variety of food and can live anywhere, its a generalist.
-1	I would add let all the samples sit in the vinegar to soak. Make sure they are dry before making on. Don't let any types get mixed up.
1	To tell the amount vinger you pour into the container, the size of the container, Ho long you rinse the sample off with distilled water. How many times you repeat each sample to get down to a writer mass.
-1	In this procedure the group calls the materials samples, instead of calling them samples they should have named the materials like they did in the chart. When they just say samples,that can mean anything. In step number one they should say why you need  to determine the mass of the four materials.
-1	Pandas in china eat only bamboo,while koalas in Australia eat only eucalyptus leaves.Both animals have an exclusive food.Pythons as said in the article are generalists.Pandas and koalas are generalists.Pandas and koalas are generalists as well.
-1	Additional information need in order to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar was poured into the four separate containers, should I buy the materials or use natural resources.
-1	To replicate this procedure you would need to know a few more steps. First of all, they did not say how much vinegar you would need to pour in the container with the samples. Also, they must specify when you weigh the samples to get the starting weight that they recorded. Also, they did not say when to record the data you have and how you are getting the difference in mass.
1	Based on the student's data, plastic type B stretched the most compared to plastic type A, C, and D. Therefore, B has the most stretchability. Two ways to improve the experimental design are to make sure each plastic starts at the same length and that the same amount of weights are used for each plastic.
1	After reading this procedure, I have noticed that I would need to know the Ph of the vinegar. Also I would need to kno how much vinegar is needed. Lastly, it is important to know what kind of cups they are using because they could have a chemical that rubes off  on the samples making the results diffrent.
1	a) When stretched plastic B seemed to be weakest and stretch the most as where plastic A seemed strongest. ^p One way is to have equal size plastics to start with. Another way is to say exactly how much weight needed to  be added to each,
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both basically eat some type of leaf and they're different from pythons because pythons don't really eat leaves.
-1	In order to replicate this experiment there are 3 things that you would need to know. The first thing is, you need to know how much vinegar to put in the containers. The second thing that you would need to know is how much of each rock sample to use in this experiment. Lastly, in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know what to use to measure the dryed rocks.
-1	In order to replicate the experiment they would need an equation to work with, a table of ingredients and the conclusion.
-1	When they are going through the procedure, they did not include the names of the tested items. They also didn't say what they were testing it for.
-1	The pandas in China are similar to the koala bear in Australia because they are not harmful. Also they dont eat a lot of diffrent things they eat bamboo and eucalyptus leaves. They are diffrent from pythons because pythons eat whatever is around if they are hungry.
-1	The additional information that you would need in order to replicate the experiment, is the amount of vinegar that you need to pour in the containers, how much of the sample that you will use and what will you use to determine the mass of the sample.
-1	A) Mt conclusion based on the students data is that plastic B had the more affect for its stretchability. Plastic A had the least stretchability when it comes to the weights of clamps on top of the bag. ^p B) Two ways the students could have improved their experiment is by including what types of plastic and how long do we leave the weights on top of plastic.
-1	China's Pandas and Australia's Koalas are similar because pandas eats almost nothing but bamboo and Koalas eat eucalyptus leaving almost exclusive. Pandas and Koalas are different from pythons because they will anything their not particular.
-1	"Pandas in China and koala bears in Austrailla are both similar because as the article states ""mammals are warm and fuzzy."" They're both mammals which are more respected at times than reptiles."
1	The additional information that you would need in order to replicate the experiment would be, what kind of containers do they want us to use? You would need a sample of each of the substances. As well as knowing what type of each substance you need. Last you would need the vinegar to pour into each of the containers, which changes the mass of each sample.
-1	Additional information that would be needed top replicate the experiment is the type of different samples. I would also need to tell us how much vineger to put into cups. If they do not spesify, then the results may come out completly different. They should also determine how to mass the materials and what measurement they would use.
1	A: Based on the student's data, plastic B is the most stretchable polymer plastic and plastic A is the least stretchable. ^p B: One way the students could improve their experiment is to perform more than just two trials to ensure their data is valid. Another way they could improve their experimental design is to specify how it tape the plastics so as to make sure their are all taped and pulled the same way.
-1	The additional information we would need to replicate the experiment would be the conculsion.
1	A conclusion made from the students data is that different plastics' length are affected by wieght in their own ways; staying the same , growing , or shortening. The students could have been more specific by writing down how long each plastic has originally before the the 2 trials. They also could have been more detailed about how much weight ,they were adding to the plastic.
-1	(A)My conclusion on the student data table is that plastic D was the strongest. It stretch up to 20 mm in both trials.^p (B)Two ways the student could have improve was to make a 3 trial or test and to be able to measure the abravasion of the plastic types.
-1	The plastic that were being stretched all come out to a different length. On the second trial of stretching the some plastics someway the numbers would forely the some give or take a few. The student could have improved the experiment by leaving the plastic to stretch larger and see if there is a different result. Also the student doesn't know if each type of plastic is the exact same so the strength could have varied and changed the whole experiment.
1	To replicate this experiment you need the materials used in the experiment also you would need to make sure you follow the directions, record your data.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because, they eat plants only. The pandas eat nothing but bamboo. And as for the koalas they eat nothing but, eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. They're both different then pythons because, its a generalist.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists. Pandas eat mostly only bamboo and koalas eat mostly only eucalyptus leaves. Both species would not respond well to change unlike pythons which are generalists. Pythons can respond well to change and can be seen in multiple locations.
1	(a) Based on the students data, I can conclude that plastic type B was the most stretchable. This is because it was stretched more than the other plastic after 5 minutes in both trials for example, plastic B stretched 22 mm in the first trial but plastic D the next most stretchable only stretched 20 mm. The students could have improved the experiment adding more trials. This would make their experiment more accurate because they will have more both to use their by. They should have also tell how many weights to add at a time, so that they, and whoever else does this experiment remains constant.
-1	Pandas bears in China and koalas bears in Australia are a like because they only eat on thing.Pandas eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves. Also they both only eat plants pythons different because the eat a lot of different things like alligator.
-1	In conclution, plastic type A and B did stretch but plastic type C got smaller and plastic type D stayed the same. ^p The student could have found another way to stretch the plastics. Their data could have been put clearer also.
1	A plastic B is more stretchable than plastic A, C and D. The student didn't mess up anywhere during the expierement otherwise there would be a bigger gape on the strecbility between two trials. ^p B The student should use the same amount of weights for each plastic and should have done a third trial.
-1	To replicate this experiment you would need to know how to go about weighing the rock's masses, how much vinegar you're putting the rocks in . Finally you need to know how much of each sample you're putting in a container.
-1	How to extract the materials from the vinegar. what conditions would the materials be drying. (ex sunny warm place or dark cold place. what conditions would the material be soaking in (Temp, light ext-- )
1	3. a) Plastic A is the most resistant and the strongest because it stretched the least out of the 4 plastics. This is due to being created with more or stronger polymer chains. ^p b) The experiment could be improved by using the same amount of the weights on each type of plastic. This would show how the strengths of the plastic differ mere accurately. Also, the trial should be performed more than 2 times. Since results varied greatly by up to 2mm with the 2nd trial, this variation would be minimized with more trials.
-1	The pandas in China are similar to the koalas in Australia because they are both specialist species. A specialist species is one that cannot adapt to the other conditions. Generalists on the other hand, ca adpt to other conditions & climates. Pandas & koalas are specialist species & they cannot adapt but pythons are generalist & they can live anywhere.
-1	First at step one they need to tell you how to determine the mass of four different samples and should also label the samples there. In step 2, you need to be told how much vinegar to pour. In step 5, it could be helpful if you were told where to let the samples dry. Then in step 6, once again you need to be told how you should measure the mass of the samples.
-1	Based on the students data the amount that has been stretched finally didn't make a difference because som when up by 1 and 2 and some just shod the same. One way the student could have improved their experiment design is telling us how many weights to add to the clamps.
-1	Plastic type D stay the same . They should had left more minutes to hang.
1	1.  The mRNA travels to the ribosomes.2.  tRNA contains an anticodon with the amino acid on it.  It goes from the cytoplasm to the ribosomes.  3.  The anticodon is bonded to the codon.4.  The amino acids are bonded together to make proteins.
-1	A) On the trial A,B,C and D stretched quiet long and plastic B is the most longest so plastic B is the best from all. On the second trial, the result is not a lot difference from the first trial, plastic A,B and C stretched 1.2 mm more and plastic D still the same. B) Students should put the original measurement for all the plastics and put in the data table. The students should leave the weights on the clamp to hang there longer than 5 minutes to see if those plastics could stretched even more.
-1	One way the student could have imomised the experiment is to try the trials more than once.
1	Some additional information needed would be where the containers are to sit. Such as in the sun or in the refrigerator. How much vinegar are we putting into containers and what kind of containers are using?
-1	"Panda's and koalas are surprisingly similar species. This is because they're specialist. They are limited to a particular region of the world because of their diet. While pythons are different because they're generalist, they can exist in a variety of environments because they can adapt. ""What favors generalists is change. What favors specialists is stability"" (Achenbanch5). In conclusion, pandas and koalas differ from pythons."
1	In order to replicate their experiment you would need additional information. First, they need to specity what the
-1	What are you going to do after you find the mass of all four samples. How much vinegar did you put in each sample.
-1	"Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia and they both differ from pythons. Pythons, like humans are generalists. ""We live in an age that favors generalists rather than specialists"" because generalist are more effective to adapting. However, pandas and koalas are specialists, ""which eats almost nothing but bamboo"" or ""eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively."" Therefore, unlike pythons, they cannot adjust."
-1	You need to determine what will happen after the the investigation how will it happen need berck down the steps.
1	"The group of students didn't specify what ""samples"" they were referring to. Secondly, they didn't include how much vinegar to add to the containers in step 2 nor did they list the size and or volume of said containers. They didn't give instructions on how or what to label the containers in step 3, or how much distilled water one would need to rinse the sample with in step 4. All of these would need to be taken into consideration in order to replicate the experiment."
-1	The pandas and koala bears there native to their country.
-1	a. In conclusion, after five minutes the plastic types were stretched longer for plastics A and B. Plastic c decreased in trial 2, and plastic d stayed the same.^p b. Two ways, the student could have improved the experiment are: 1. Added or decreased the weights amount in trial 2.2. let the weights hang for longer/shorter amount of time.
1	In order to replicate group's expirament we would  need to know the amount of vinegar that we put into the containers and we would also need equal amount of each samples. We would also need to know for how long each material is rinsed and the volume of the container.
-1	In order to replicate the experiment, you would need to why they are preforming this experiment and what it is trying to prove. You would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers to keep that a constant. Lastly, it would be important to know the amount of each sample to add to the vinegar so that the samples aren't different because that could vary your results.
1	In order to replicate the experiment, additional information is needed. You need to know how much vinegar to put in each container, in step 3, you need to know what material you are putting in each container. You also should know how long to rinse the samples and how much water to rinse them in (step 4).
-1	"Pandas in China are similar to Koalas in Australia and different than pythons because Pandas and Koalas are specialists species. The article explains. ""A specialist is China's pandas which eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's Koala bear which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively."" Pythons, on the other hand are generalists, as they can can adapt to a wide variety of circumstances, going from Asia to Florida as pets."
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both eat almost everything, but certain things. They are both different from pythons because according to the article a python ate an human which can show it eats about anything.
-1	-Change the amount of havre. ^p -Leave the samples to sit and dry for more or less than 30 minutes. ^p -Pour vinegar in each of for separate, but different containers.
-1	Pandas and koalas are similar because they are both exclusive to the place they live. You won't find pandas anywhere but China, same with koalas in Australia. This is different from pythons because the article said pythons can live anywhere from California to Delaware , any place with a climate similar to their original Asian habitat.
-1	-Repeat step 1-6 ^p -Round this data for the 2nd trial ^p -Compare the 2 trials and find the average mass for the four samples. ^p -Observe the data and make a conclusion on the experiment.
-1	What you would need is the imformation on how much vinegar is added to every sample. For example, one sample can be in a different amount of vinegar. So that can throw their ending masses off.
1	a) A conclusion I can draw with the data present is that some plastics are more stretchy than others. For example plastic B is much more stretchy then plastic A. ^p b) To improve there experimental design and validity the results they could of added another trial. Also to say how much plastic measured before the plastic was stretched.
-1	A) Plastic B seemed to be the most durable because in it stretched 22mm in t2 it stretched 23mm and the least durable seemed to be plastic A because in T1 only stretched 10mm and in T2 it stretched 12mm B) They could have specified the type of plastic and long in seconds was the plastic being stretched.
-1	In order to be able to redo this experiment, you need to have all of the information. We need to know more about how they did this experiment. More details is better.
1	Based on the students data it is possible to see how much each type of plastic stretched, but not how much weight was needed to stretch it that far as the original length of the plastic. ^P Two ways the student could have improved the experiment are to make a more detailed procedure. Include the weight of the type of plastic, clanes instructions etc and too create a clearer table that includes the types of plastic, the original length and the weight added.
-1	Students could have made his or her own hypothisis to test. Also should have the procedure more than 2 times.
-1	Pandas are similar to koalas because they both eat eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively as it states in the article. They are both different from pythons because they are not reptiles.
-1	First I would need to know what they used to determine the mass. It would also be helpful if they put the 4 different kinds of materials they used in the actual experiment procedure. In case there was no data table present. They could also more specific as to what exactly they kept the samples in and where they put them. So I would no not to keep them in direct light for shade for that matter. I would also need to no how much of each material to use.
-1	Pandas eat only bamboo and koalas eat only eucalyptus leaves which makes them specialist species. They can only live in one area. Pythons are specialists, so they can live in a large range of places.
-1	The conclusion that I have drawn is that plastic type D streached the most which makes it more durable than the rest. Two ways he could have improved was by telling us how much weught was added and by telling us he averaged out the three plastic samples strechness.
-1	Panda bears eat basically nothing but bamboo. Koala bears eat eucalyptus leaves. These animals are different from pythons. Pythons can get up to at least six feet long. They eat any animal they want. Pythons can eat a alligator. Panda bear and koala can get eaten by a python.
-1	Some additional information I would need would include what objects to determine the mass of. Also to replicate this procedure I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container, seeing as the group doesn't give an exact amount. I would also need to know how much distilled water to rinse each sample with. Finally their procedure doesn't tell exactly how to determine the mass.
-1	A) The whole procedure worked out well. I think the results came out to be almost the same when they repeated it.^p B) I think the student should have 'did' a third trial. Also I think he should have chase two different plastics to see how each one does with clamps hanging from them on the table
-1	The data shows that the plastic types stretched about the same in both trials. In the procedures the student must say which she is recording the data. I think the data would have a better conclusion if the student did another trial for each different plastic.
-1	Plastic D is concictast with how much it stretches state that they are using different plastics state the weight that was added.
-1	In order to replicate the experiment they would need to determin what the materials were, they would have to establish a control and they would have to give directions to find the difference in mass.
-1	You would need 1). More trials 2). Different types of samples and 3). Maybe have have to samples sit and dry for more than 20 mins.
-1	"Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists, ""China's panda, which eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's koala bear, which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively."" They both only eat a specific food. Pythons, however eat a wide variety as foods including alligators. Pythons are also generalists, which are more abundant compared to the pandas + koalas."
-1	"We would need to know what the investigation was, need to know what kined of ""sample"" their talking about. What they used to determine the mass. All of this information will help the reader help understaned the investigation better."
1	After reading the group's procedure, I can see that additional information is needed to do the experiment. First, I would need to the materials needed for the lab. I would need to get these items in ahead of time, and have the right things like containers. I would also need to know what kind of rocks were used. If I was looking at a sheet or instructions  that contained  only the procedure, I would need to know what rocks were used. A third thing the procedure hasn't told us is the amount of vinegar. For this to be a valid experiment, we would need to use the same amount of vinegar.
-1	Pandas inChina and koalasin Australia both excusively eat one food, but a python can have a more diverse diet depending on its current habitat.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia by being one of the few animals less favored on earth. How according the experiment that was tested pythons are one of the few animals most favored on earth.
-1	A conclusion based on this experiment is plastic B was the most stretched to 22mm, then on the second trial A stretched 23mm. On the other hand plastic A, C and D was lower than 22 and 23mm both times.
-1	In China pandas are similar to koalas in Australia because they both eat very little. They are both different from pythons because they eat a lot.
-1	"China's panda and Australia's koalas are similar because they're both specialist and favor stability as stated in paragraph 21, ""what favors specialists is stability"". They're different from pythons because they're generalist and they favor change and also stated in paper, ""what favors generalist is change""."
-1	The additional information you need in order to replicate the experiment would be the time the example was started,the difference in mass from all four samples and determining which sample had more mass,which sample had the least. An explanation of why the amount of mass was that amount
-1	Plastic type D was the most stretched out of all of the other plastics. The student needed to repeat the steps for a 3rd time also. The student should not have used the same plastic over they should have gotten a new place do the results would show validity to results.
1	You would need to know how big of cups to use. How much vinegar was put in each cup and how big of a sample to get.
-1	I would need the size of the containers. How or what the temperature of the water that they used to rinse the samples.
-1	A-
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo and pandas eat eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively as it says in the article. Pandas and koalas are different from phythons because its Asia that inhabits the climates that are similar to the 3rd wheel continental United States.
1	"A0 I conclude that plastic type ""B"" has the highest amount of stretchability. Plastic B is able to stretch from 22 to 23mm. I can also conclude plastic ""A"" has the lowest stretchability at 10 to 12mm. ^p B) One way to make the investigation more valid is by having the length of each type of plastic be the same. Also the students need to make sure the plastic was taped the same way with the same tape. The students also need to use the same table for all four plastics."
1	"a) Plastic type B is the most stretchable.^p b). Make sure to say what kind of tape is being used; scotch tape would be too weak. Also, when saying ""perform a second trial (T2) exactly like the first trial (T1), it can't be exactly the same. You have to  use new samples of each type of plastic (A, B, C +D)."
-1	I think e 11/12 40/40.
-1	"Pandas are similar to Koalas because they are both specialists. What this means is that they both need to live off certain foods, or ""Panda eats almost nothing but bamboo, or (a) Koala eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively,"" they couldn't live anywhere else because they live off these foods."
-1	Koala's and panda's are both specialists, which means that their is only 1 food that is essential to their diets and can't be found much of anywhere else. While a python is a generalists and can survive in other places because it's food source is not limited.
-1	In order to replicate this experiment additional iformation is needed. The samples ^p need to be listed. Also why those  samples were chosen needs  to be ^p added in order to replicate the experiment. Another thing that needs to be added is the reason why we are finding the difference in mass.
-1	The students conclusion was not much because there was many types of plastics to choose from. ^p The students could have improved the experiment if the student picked a certain type of plastic not any type. Other reason is that they not the weights in the same spot in trial 1 and trial 2.
-1	The information the students left out was the control. The control of the expiriment was the actions of the vinegar in the water that affacted the samples.
-1	"Additional information you would need in order to replicate this experiment is: How much vinegar to pour into each container. It should say what each ""sample"" is in the procedures. A list of materials."
-1	"China's panda and Australia's koala bear are both called ""specialists"" in the article ""One man's pet, Another's Invasive species"" by Joel Achenbach. They both have limited diets, mainly eating 1 food, for the panda it's bamboo and for the koala it's eucalyptus leaves. These animals differ from the python because it is called a ""generalist"" and the python is carnivorous and can eat anything."
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists. They are different from pythons are generalists. According to the article, we live in an age that favors generalists rather than specialists. This is why there is a growing trend of keeping reptiles as pets.
-1	I need to know how big the container is & how many of them.
-1	To replicate the experiment i need four different example, then i need to pour vinegar in each but identical containers, then i need to place a sample of one a material into one container and lable then take it out of the container after 34 h and dry for 30 minutes. Finally determine the mass of each Example.
1	"a) Plastic type/polymer ""B"" had the best stretchability out of the other polymer plastics. The data shows that in ""B""s both trials it stretched 22 and 23 mm farthest than any other plastic. ^p b) Two ways to improve the design are by doing more trials to be more accurate and by stating the amount of weight put on each bag (the same amount of weight)."
-1	Maybe he use the clamp to attach it before he add in the agredienta.
-1	Based on the students data plastic type D stretched the most which means it is probably made of weaker polymers. Plastic type A stretched the smallest amount which means it is made of the strongest polymers. ^p Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design or validity of the results are to measure how thick in width each of the plastic strips were before and after the experiment, and to describe the difference in texture (if any) of each plastic.
-1	"After reading the groups procedure, the additional information that I would need to replicate this experiment would be a control. They don't have anything to compare their data to, they should have used acid rain and distilled water as there experiments. Also they didn't show the number of trials which should be more than one so they could get an average and get more valid data. The group also should have told me the amount of vinegar to put into each cup and the amount of ""one material"" in each cup. I have an idea how much ""one material"" is."
-1	In order to replicate this experiment, it should be useful to know how much mass of each sample you are trying to start with. Each starting mass the group used were different, having a significant effect on this results. You would also want to know how much vinegar the group is putting into each container. Also, it would be important to know how the group is covering the samples from the containers. Depending on how the samples are removed could play a major role on the final results.
-1	Pandas and koala bears are similar because they both eat trees/ leaves. They dont eat any meat, their omnivores. Pandas eat bamboo, and koala's eucalyptus leaves. Unlike the python they are carnivores, they dont eat trees and leaves, they eat meat. Pythons usually eat animals smaller than them, like mice squirrels, rats and cats.
1	Plastic sample B stretched the farthest.^p The experiment could have been improved by adding exact amount of what to be added on the plastics. Also to measure how much of the plastics edge to be taped to the table so they are standing at the same point.
-1	The mass,use different mass. Different type of materials and different containers,
1	Active transport-requires energyPassive transport- requires no energyosmosis- the movement of water from one place to another
-1	Both pandas and koalas are similar because they both only eat 1 thing , bamboo and eucalyptus leaves. You can only find these items in certain places. But they are different to pythons because they eat living things such as mice, and you can find mice everywhere.
-1	"The way pandas in China are the same as koalas in Australia because they both only eat one thing. ""Specialist is China's panda which eat exclusivly bamboo or the koala which eats only eucalyptus leaves."" They are different from pythons because they eat meat. 'A python once swallowed a whole aligator."" These are why they are different."
1	(a) From the given results, one can conclude that plastic type B is the stretchiest type out of the four that were tested. ^p (b) However, there are same ways that the validity of this experiment could be improved. One improvement could be to specify the original length of the plastic. If the sizes vary, the data found is useless. Uncomparable. Another improvement to this experiment could be to perform more trials. You can not obtain consistancy, a needed ingredient in an ideal experiment, in only two trials.
1	A) A conclusion I could come up with in this experiment is that plastic type B has stretched 22-23mm which makes it the most stretched but out of the 4 they tested in both trials. While plastic type A had the least stretchability at 10 & 12mm. B) Two ways the students could have improved this experiment is they should have done at least 3 or more trials to better the information given. They also should have made sure in step 2 that each plastic was hanging off the table at the same length so it would be a fair way to measure at the end.
-1	The group is missing a whole in 1 of important details. I would need to know how much vinegar to use for one
1	During protein synethesis, the DNA is being replicated and forming mRNA durning transcription. Then after it leaves the nucleus, it enters the cytoplasm. Translation takes place in the cytoplasm. A polypeptide chain forms during tanslation which turns into proteins. The tRNA carries 3 anticodons to the 3 condons on the mRNA. When that is all done it makes a chain of amino acids.
-1	Pandas are similar to koalal because specialist. They mainly eat one food that keeps them alive. In if they were moved then they would most likely die. They are both different than a python because a python is a generalist. It can live in many different regions. In paragraph 15 it says that they have ability to inhabant 1/2 in the U.S.
1	The information that the procedure is missing to be able to replicate the experiment is the size of the containers. The size of each sample and how much vinegar did they use. Without these missing information then you can not replicate the experiment.
-1	To replicate the experiment you would need to know what kind of samples you could use, such as marble or plastic. You would also need to know how to determine the samples and to find the difference in mass at the end. Between the starting mass and the ending mass of each sample.
1	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need (other than the procedure) what samples to use (what materials), how much vinegar goes into each container and what shape the samples should be in. These pieces of information are important because using too little or too much vinegar will give different results. Using any sample other than the ones listed will give different results due to some materials inability to be changed by acid rain. Finally, the shape is important because the surface area could differ making the vinegar more or less chaotic during 24 hours.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both eat mostly only one kind of food. Pandas eat mostly bamboo and koalas eat mostly eucalyptus leaves. Pandas and koalas are different from pythons because pythons will eat anything they can find. For example, that pythons in Florida that tried to eat an alligator.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because pandas eats almost nothing but bamboo and koalas eats eucalyptus & thats mainly what they eat. There both are different from pythons because pythons eat animals and pandas, koalas eat plants.
-1	According to the students data I would conclude that plastic B was the most stretchy compared to the other 3 plastics. The students could of added the weights in the same exact order and made sure she measured in the same measurements.
-1	I would need to know what the outcome was suppose to be or what it was suppose to look like. The information given is good but doesn't really explain why they were doing this experiment for, but the table was good and understandable.
-1	Pandas in China and Koalas in Australia are similar because they are both specialists. Also, they both eat mostly plants in the article, the author states that the Panda eats nothing but bamboo and Koalas eat eucalyptus leaves. Finally, they both have to live to a specific  place like China and Australia, while generalist can live anywhere.
1	In order to replicate the experiment, you would also need to know if the containers were covered to ensure that none of the vinegar evaporated. You would also need to know at what temperature the samples in the containers were being kept and that all four were identical. A third additional piece of information you would need to know is what the samples are and you would need to label them. In the procedure the samples' identities are not given.
-1	In the second trial, the length for plastic A and B went up. For plastic C the longer length was 14 in the first trail. But in plastic D, the amount stretched stood exactly the same. Two ways the student could have improve this experimental design is drawing a line graph and give the data table a little more details.
-1	They would also need to include how much vineagar was needed to add to the samples. They also need to include how much of each sample there should be, and that you need to find the difference of the mass at the end of the procedure.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists. They eat almost nothing. They are both different from pythons because pythons are carnivors. They eat mammals. As pandas eat bamboo and koalas eat leaves.
-1	Chinese pandas and Australian koalas are both specialist species, which are meant to survive to only one environment. They are different from pythons because pythons are a generalist species that can survive in varying environments or different food sources.
-1	"Panda's and Koala's are alike eachother and different than python's by one major thing. It said in the article ""A specialist is China's panda which almost eats nothing but bamboo or Australia's Koala bear which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively."" This one thing is their diets."
-1	You should obtain 4 seperate containers. And then mass the container so you can subtract the weight of the container when you mass the samples. This will give you just the mass of the samples, not the samples and container combined. The amount of vinegar to add to the samples should also be determined more clearly.
1	These include passive/active transport, facilitated diffusion, and osmosis. Passive transport does not require energy, but active transport does. Passive transport is high to low concentration, and active transport is low to high concentration. Facilitated diffusion is when a protein in the cell membrance is used to aid in the transfer of substances. Osmosis is the diffusion of water across the cell membrane.
-1	The panda and koala are both specialist and they only eat one thing. They are both different from the Python because A Python could eat anything from a mouse to deer and they move alotmore.
-1	They should add how much vinegar to add to each sample. For this lab to be more accurate they should have also added more trials as well as adding a constant variable such as a rock in just water.
1	a) Plastic type B is the stretchiest plastic. In T1 it  Stretched 22 mm, and in T2 it stretched 23mm. The least stretched plastic was type A. In T1, A stretched 10mm and in T2 it stretched 12mm. Type D was second stretchiest and type C was behind D. ^p b) Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design/validity of the experiment is having a specific size of the original piece of plastic to stretch, and having a specific weight of the weight stretching the plastic. Constant keep the results of experiment valid.
1	According to this data table plastic type B has the best stretchability than the stretchability of plastic type A. ^p B. Torbe more accurate say how much the weight weighs and that you have been using the same for the same amount of time. Also, make sure that the student is using the same amount of each plastic.
1	You would need to know the amount of vinegar poured in each seperate container, also you would need to know what the sample is and if you should put the containers in a very dark or sunny place for 24 hours.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both part of the specialist species. A panda eats almost nothing but bamboo and a koala eats almost nothing but eucalyptus leaves. Because of this, they differ from pythons which are part of the generalist species. Pythons can live in many places and they do well around humans.
-1	Make sure they start with the same mass.
1	The additional information that i would need to replicate this experiment is what size containers will be needed what size of marble, limestone, wood and plastic will be needed also what kind of vinegar was used if specified.
-1	Some information I would need to have during the procedure would be wither or not to have the same amount of samples not just their mass. Also I would need to know the amount of vinegar needed to pour into the containers. And finally where do I pour the samples when filter and after the containers ?
-1	You would need more vinegar and marble, limestone, wood and plastic to replicate the experiment.
1	In order to replicate this experiment, I would first need to know how much vinegar was poured into each container so I don't put in too much or too little. I would also need to know the size of the containers they used because bigger or smaller containers could affect how the vinegar affected the 4 samples and lastly, if I had only looked at the group's procedure, I would need to know what four samples the students used so that I could replicate the experiment. And then, I would need to know where the containers were kept so I could give mine the same amount of light and other things.
-1	One conclusion I made is that everytime in trial 2 it goes farther than in trial 1 the numbers increase. Two ways the student have improved on their experiment is by is by being more specific in their procedure and by adding a trial 3.
-1	"Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are specialists. Meaning they eat nothing else, but bamboo or eucalyptus  leaves: That is to say they are different from pythons because in the article it says, "" a python swallowed an alligator. "" Emphasizing it is harder for them to adapt to certain conditions."
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they tend to get fod or eat the same meal a day while pythons are endangering species, the they largo wood rat.
-1	Pandas and koalas are the same because they only eat one thing. They are different from pythons because pythons eat animals and pandas and koalas eat vegetation.
-1	You will need the data chart also the procedure of the exprerement to replicate it.
-1	A conclusion could be that different plastics have different amounts that it could be stretched at. The student could have improved the experimental design by having 3 trials an varity of cups.
-1	In order for I for  replicate this expirement I woukd need to know what are the reaserching with this expirement what kind of result are  being booked at and the mass of each sample at the end of expirment  theie results.
-1	"Pandas & koalas are similar because they both are classified as specialist & they both eat plants. While the pythons are generalist that eat meat & animals. According to the article it states ""a python swallowed an alligator & which eats almost nothing but bamboo."" These 2 auntes show how both animal have diffrent traits, & eatinhabits are just one of them."
-1	The students have to make sure the test results are accurate and that the answers are precise.
-1	China's panda bear and Australia's koala bear are similar because they are both a specialist species. Also, they both eat for the most part, one type of food. They both differ from a python because pythons are generalist and very adaptive.
-1	The pandas and the koalas are similar because they are both animals that are forcing and that are harmless. Unlike the python, which is a deadly, venerous snake, the panda and koalas are left alone in there habitats, while the viable snakes (python) are brought to the U.S. In the story, it says how the panda only eats bamboo and the koala eats eucalyptus leaves, meaning they are herbavores.
-1	"The Procedure is very flowed because I can't even understand half of it, When they are talking about the ""four samples"". They need to clarify what the samples are. They also need to clearly give the distinction of the container, the samples, and where viniger is poured into. Lastly, they need to not write step 3 because the container, sample and label have no refereced and are just plain renthstig."
-1	To replicate the experiment, I would need to know the amount of vinegar use in each cup. I would also need to know the amount of distilled water for their more explanation 3 must be better explained.
-1	The additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment are what to use to determine the mass, which would be a triple beam balance. You would also need to know the amount of the sample that would be needed to more in step 3. You would also need to know what the 4 samples you are testing are. Those samples would be marble, limestone, wood and plastic.
-1	More information that I need is what materials did they put into the containers because they did tell us, and they didn't what they did after they let it sit for 24 hours and before they rinsed the containers. Also they didn't lable each measurement on the chart.
-1	China's panda eats almost nothing but bamboo. Australia's koala bear eats eucalyptus and leaves almost exclusively. That's the different between China's panda and Australia's koala.
-1	"a)Our hypothesis was collect that plastic type would stretch the farthest because it is the most durable.^p (b)One way to improve their design was to add more to step seven like ""repeat steps 1-6 with new pieces of plastic""."
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both eat food exclusively. The panda eats just bamboo while koalas eat mainly eucalyptus leaves. The python is different because it would eat anything; it would even eat an alligator as described in paragraph 14.
-1	You will need to do the same steps over. But you need to be safe with gougles, apnn, maybe gougles.
-1	Based on the student's data plastic B and D stretched almost  twice as much as A and C so therefore, B and D are most likely made of branched chain polymers whereas A and C are made of linear polymers.The student could have  improved his or her procedure by clarifying where exactly the plastic were tape on the table in order to keep the data constant. If the tape was slightly higher we for some plastic this and have affected the data.The student should also clarify where  to put the clamp on the plastic for the same reasons.
-1	Both the panda and koalas have a paw like shape and only have one type of food source and they don't leave or try to find different food source like python.
1	To replicate the experiment , you would need to know what samples to test, how much vinegar to put in the containers, and the temperature in which the samples are kept for 24 hours.
-1	Plastic type A is the strongest type and has the strongest polymers. Two ways in which the experiment could have been better is that the student could have added the weight of the clamps to this data and the student could have also added the table height.
1	Additional information that would be needed. We need to know how much vinegar to putt in each sample, what temperature to keep sample at, and how long to rinse the samples for.
-1	a. Based on the students data I can conclude that T2 overall had better results that T1, for T1, A, B and C were all longer than T1. ^p 3b. The student could have improved the experimental design and for validity of the results by specifying the amount of weight that was added to the clamps and the student should also have specifyed the plastics that were used to make a more valid point. ^p A-10, 12. ^p B-22, 23. ^p C-14, 13. ^p D-20, 20.
1	When the mRNA leaves the nucleus, 1. it goes to the endoplasmic reticulum where protein synthesis begins.  2. Ribosomes then move in to begin the process of synthesis where anticodons are moved on to the correct codons transferring the correct amino acid code that is to be made. 3. the amino acid is made and attached to all other amino acids beside it with Peptide bonds. 4. A stop codon tells the amino acids to stop and the previous amino acid becomes the last in the chain, making a complete protein.
1	a) Based on the students data you can conclude that plastic. Type B has the most stretchability. ^p b) One thing the student could have done top improve their experimental design would have been to tell how much weight to put on the clamps. They also could have said which side to clamp because edge could mean left, right or anything
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because in the article it states that they can live anywhere, but eat very little. It says pandas eat bamboo and koalas eat leaves. They differ from pythons because koalas and pandas are specialists and a python is a generalist.
-1	The pandas  in China are like the koalas in Australia because they are both specialist animals that can adapt to a specific environment and food sources. On the other hand they use both different from the generalist python who can really adapt to a new environment and change its diet easily.
-1	Number 2, pour vinegar in eatch of the four seperate not identical containers. This can help determen the mass of eatch item and help with the experement from what we read, after placing samples into the container then letting it sit will determen the mass.
-1	The conclusion of the investigation could be that plastic A was the best because when weights were added didn't stretch that much compared to the other plastics. Two ways the student could've improved the experiment is by adding the same weights to each plastic and when starting the experiment use plastics with the same length.
-1	Additional information needed for the groups procedure is that the group should have stated what kind of samples were needed to perform the experiment. What also could have been identified is the amount of vinegar the student should pour into the composition the sample. Another steps that could help a student when replicating into maybe have an exact measurement of the samples, instead of having each one vary from 7.2 - 11.2. For example maybe have each one way 9.8 to see easier which sample to affected more by acid.
1	The conclusion that can be drawn from the data done in that plastic type B. stretched the most, which was 21mm in T1 and 22mm in T2. One way the student could've improved the experiment is to add another trial. Also by using the same weight to weights.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koala bears because there both specialist. Panda's in China only eat bamboo and kolas from Australia only eat eucalyptus leaves. There both different from a python because a python is a generalist which could possibly live anywhere a eat a variety of things.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to Koalas in Australia. I know this because in the artical it said that both animals eat only one type of food Pandas bamboo and Koalas eucalyptus leaves. They are different from pythons because eat a variety of foods.
-1	First you would need a control. The absence of what is effecting the dependant. in this case the dependant variable is the mass of the material and the vinegar is effecting it, so the control would be the material subjected to water instead of vinegar. This group had don't write down the amount of vinegar. its very important that this amount is held constant throughout the experiment. They should also mention the mass of each material because each of them have to have the same mass in order for the results to be accurate and reliable.
-1	The conclusion I have come to base off of the students data is that the most durable plastic strength base is (1). I know this to be true because there is no length difference between T1 & T2.
1	In conclusion, it can be said that plastic. Type B had the most amount stretched because its numbers in T1 (22)and T2 (23) were the highest. Also the plastic type that was more durable and was not stretched is muuh was plastic type A because its number in T1(10) was and T2 (12) were the lowest to improve this experiment,it would be better to include three trials and include the plastics type initial measurements to make the data table more specific and efficient.
-1	"A panda and koala are specialists because they both only eat one thing. "" which eats almost nothing but bamboo ...eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively"" the can't survive off anything else, but a python can eat a large variety of foods, and survive in many different locations, it is a generalist."
-1	Pandas is similar to koalas because pandas eat bamboo and koala eat only eucalyptus leaves an they thought eat meat and python eat meat.
-1	"Pandas From China and koalas From Australia are alike because there both animals that don't really do any harm and stay to themselves. they mainly eat one thing which for pandas is bamboo & koalas is eucalyptus leaves. they are nothing like pythons, pythons are dangerous & eat other animals, the article said ""A python swallowed an alligator."" Pandas/koalas are nicer animals than pythons."
-1	"The similarities between the panda and the koala are that they are specialists and mainly eat only one thing. The difference between pandas and koalas compared to pythons is that pythons eat almost anything. For example in the article it states ""You could conceivably have pythons snacking their war right up the Potomac."""
1	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers. You would also need to know what the materials are that you're putting into containers. You also might need to know the size of the identical containers and what kind of containers they are. All these things are essential to replicating this experiment.
1	The groups prosedure could  use, they could add to find the diffrence in mass at the end. Also list the type of meteral they roused. And they should tell you how much and what kind of vinegar they foused.
-1	For this experiment, I would want to know how much vinegar I should pour into the cup. Pouring different amonts could change the mass. The other information I would need is if I needed to rinse the material in a timely manner (10 sec, 20 sec etc). this could also effect the mass of the material. I would also need to know if the amount of the samples had to be the same size. That also could effect the difference of the mass's.
-1	I guess follow the steps to make the experiment is risht, like allow to Dry in 30 min. 2 let it be separate with the vinegar the little containers. 3 Go over to make sure nothing goes wrong.
-1	They are alike because koala and panda eat plants. The python's eat meat and are generalists not specialists.
1	By the result of the student's investigation they have concluded that plastic type B is the stretchiest polymer of all four and plastic type A is the least stretchiest polymer. ^p Three ways the student could have improved the experimental design is by starting off with each polymer with the same length. The same amount of weights for each polymer and repeating the experiment 3 times instead of 2.
-1	Based on the data each plastic improved on T2. Two ways they could have improved the experiment was by making sure they used the sam weight for each trial and also use a stop watch to get exact time.
1	The mRNA enters the ribosome.Start codon enters P site, second codon at A site.tRNA adds a amino acid to the codon at the P site and A site.The P site codon breaks apart and the codon at the A site takes its place and the process continues until you hit a stop codon, the chain of amino acids creates a protein.
-1	In order to replicate the experiment you will need to know why are the students making this experiment? Why are they trying to get the mass of the elements listed in the table?
-1	Maybe after the experiment this procedure should be done a second  time to see the results come out, the name react ways.
-1	In order to replicate this experiment I would also need materials I would use. I would need the amount of vinegar in the container, and I would also need time limit to do the test.
-1	A specialist is like a panda, which eats almost nothing but bamboo or a koala bear which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. While a generalist like a python is arguably a human being. who with the assistance of technology can live anywhere. Specialists are picky, while generalists aren't at all.
-1	I dont think i would add any additional information, The procedure seems pretty straight forward and very informational.
1	Plastic type B has the greatest stretchability out of the other four. The student could have done more trials. They could of also tell us a specific weight.
-1	In order to duplicate this experiment, I would need to determine the starting mass, ending mass and difference in mass.
-1	A- Based on the students data I conclude that plastic type B is the most flexible, type A is the least, and type D remained the same throughout the trials. ^P B- The studed could have improved the experimental design and validity of results by, adding heavier weights to the experiment, and extend or shorten the 5min time period.
-1	a) I conclude that the it plastics tested showed some increased in length when stretched.I believe that the plastics way that they were stretched increased in length over to me that what I found in this experiment.^p b) I believe they should have identify the different plastics.I also believe that they should of said how much weight the plastic was holding and many. That what should of been added.
-1	They both only eat one thing. The koala bear eat a no of eucalyptus. The panda eats almost nothing but bamboo.
-1	You will need a timer to determine the time that the vinegar dryed up.
-1	"pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they are both specialists, and this age ""favors generalists rather than of specialists"". After all, generalists like the pythons can adapt to various changes in things such as climate, whereas China's panda depends on ""almost nothing but bamboo"" as their food sources. Therefore, it's clear how the pandas and koalas are very different than pythons in their habits."
-1	As you can see the students investigation went well. The materials they used were marble, limestone, wood and plastic. By look of the data you can see that the starting mass for all of them is 9,8-marble, 10,4-limestone, 11,2-wood, 2,2-plastic. Then the end mass read 9,4-marble, 9,1-limestone, 11,2-wood and 7,1-plastic. As you can see all of them exsape limestone decreased. As you can see the investigation took a lot of time to put together. So I believe as I have laid out for you that this investigation took a lot of time and they came out with wonderful results.
-1	The experiment is and requires everyday materials. If I did this experiment, I would include the temperature of the vinegar and the measured amount of vinegar in each container.
-1	Pandas and koalas are pretty simalar to each other, but both are very different from the python. Pandas and koalas both eat one type of thing. Pandas eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves. In the article it says pythons ate alligators, and rats. They eat anything while the other two don't.
1	Type A plastic stretched the most. ^p Attach the plastic to the side of the table in a more effective way, and provide the names of the plastics rather than giving them variables.
-1	Pandas and koalas are different from pythons because they are specialists. Pandas almost exclusively eat bamboo, while koalas almost exclusively eats eucalyptus leaves. This means that these animals are really only able to live in certain areas, while the generalist python can feed on countless foods and can deal with a fairly large range of temperatures.
-1	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know what the the types of materials where. Also how much of each material would you need in order to be able to do the experiment, then it says you measure the mass of each substances. You would need to know if they found the mass in the cups or not. That could affect the out come if you don't know.
1	After reading the group's procedure I have determined they could add what 'four different samples' you are using during the experiment. The group should also be specific with the amount of vinegar that should be poured into each containers. The temperature at which the ''samples'' are to dry ifor 30 min should be regulated because if it is too hot or too cold the experiment could be ruined.
-1	A) Plastic D stretched the same lenght in both that but plastic type A is the stretchrest. B) They could have done more thats and, the should have use different weights for more results.
1	a) Based  on the students data, plastic type A had the strongest resistance against weight and therefore makes it stronger than the rest because plastic A stretched 10-12mm while plastic B stretched 22-23mm. ^p b) The students should have had the same size plastic strips for each type. A third and an averaged measurement for each plastic would make the data even more valid.
-1	Clearly this group procedure is not clear. They ask you to determine the mass of four different samples. They did not state which samples. They also did not state what unit of mass to use when weighing the objects. Without that I cannot be sure if my data will be reliable.
1	a) In this experiment,it  can be concluded that plastic B had the most stretchability with 22mm in trial 1 and 23mm in trial 2. Also I can conclude that plastic A of the polymer plastics stretched the least with an average of 11m overall. Then plastic C stretched an average of 12mm and plastic D stretched 20mm^p b)Two ways to improve this experiment would have been to make sure each plastic is exactly the same length as the add to the end of the plastic they could also add a 3rd trial to make the experiment more valid.
1	Facultative diffusion- Particles moving through the protein channels from hig to low concentrationDiffusion- something moving through a cell membrane from high to low concentrationosmosis- water moving through a cell membrane from high concentration to low concentration
-1	Some additional information you need in order to replicate the experiment is more information how much time and hold in order to determine the mass of each sample. Also instead of containers use glass bottles.
-1	A) The plastic type B was the stretchiest and A was the least stretchy. ^p B) One way this experiment design could be improved is have multiple times recording the stretch length like 5, 10, 15 minutes. The other way is adding more weights.
-1	In order to replicate this experiment, a few pieces of additional information are needed. You wold need to know how much vinegar is being added to the containers. You would also need to know how much of one material is considered to be a sample. It is neccessary to know how to label the different containers since they are identical.
-1	I conclude, based on the data, that out of the four different polymer plastics, plastic type B was able to stretch the most mm, 23mm. Other plastic type such as A only stretched 12mm; plastic type C only stretched 13mm and plastic type b only stretched 20mm.
-1	After rending the groups procedure, there are some things that i would need or is additional information would be, what type of samples I use, the students tell use to figure out the mass of 4 samples, what kind something else i could know is the point to the experiment in the procedure. It doesn't tell me why to do these. A final piece of information  i can know is what object will be used to measure the mass, instead of determine the mass of four different samples-they can say, use a _ to measure.
1	In order to replicate this experiment one would need to know several things. First, the amount of vinegar added would have to be specified. Second, one would have to observe change in color and size of the samples, if any. Third, the procedure doesn't tell you to find the difference in mass, which you should.
-1	They are similar because they each eat plants from the enviroment like the panda eats nothing but bamboo and the koala bear eats eucalyptus leaves exclusivly. They are both different from pythons because they don't eat other species.
-1	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know several more piecesof information. One of them being the amount of each material (wood, plastic, marble and limestone). You would also need to know how much vinegar to add. Finally, a constant for each material would alsohelp.
-1	Pandas and koalas are similar to pandather because the are exclusive to their habitats. pandas only live in China because of the bamboo and koalas line in Australia because they only eat the eucalyptus leaves. Both are different from pythons because pythons can adapted to different enviornments and food. An example would be how the pythons were introduced to Florida.
-1	Pandas are similar to Koala's because they are both specialists, they both eat pretty much one food sourse and that's it. They are both different from pythons because pythons are generalists, they will eat anything plus they are scaled while Koalas and Pandas have far.
-1	After reading the procedure, I would like to know the time given for each material. Also, if their were any color changed and what was added to the material.
-1	As the author mentions, pandas and koalas are specialists. They eat safety bamboo and eucalyptus leaves respectively. A python, however, is a generalist, and can eat many things, allowing it to survive in many more areas.
-1	In order to replicate this experiment there are a few things that could be done. One would be to say how large each sample should be. It should also include what type of sample is being tested & another thing would be to include how much vinegar to use. Another good thing would be to have multiple trials.
-1	Record mass of all different samples, record the starting mass of each sample, record the entry mass and the difference in mass.
-1	Pandas and Koalas are similar to each other because they both just stay in their environment and eat leaves and plants. They are different from pythons because pythons are reptiles and they eat other animals, possible helping them go extinct.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both only really eat one kind of food. They differ from the pythons because according to the article pythons eat living things and have been ''imperiling five endangered species.''
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both A specialist, in the article it says that a panda would eat nothing but bamboo, and koala would ecalyptus leaves. They are different from pythons because pythons are A generalist, the article say that can live anywhere, and this species have become most abundant.
-1	a) Plastic type A increased the more from the first trial to the second trial. It went from 10mm to 12mm. Type C was the only type of plastic that decreased the length. Type D stayed the same at 20mm of length. ^p b) The student could of had a control group which could of been a different type of plastic. Also the student could of had a third trial to see how it would change the amount the plastic was stretched from the first and second trials.
-1	Pandas in China and Koalas in Australia are similar because they are able to survive on a one type of food. As stated in the article that pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo and Australia's koala bears that eats eucalyptus leaves exclusively. Both of the bears are different from pythons because pythons eat animals that could be endangered while koalas and pandas eat only leaves.
-1	You would need to give information on what the experiment is about.
-1	A) Plastic B had the greatest lengths in both trials. ^p B) The students could have used more weight and they coud do the experiment over again to get better results.
-1	I have concluded that plastic B is the stretchiest and plastic A is the least stretchiest. A validity issue could have been leaving the weights on to long. Another validity issue could have been the measuring of the plastics was off.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because ''China's pand, which eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's koala bear, which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively.'' They are different from pythons because pythons eat mostly anything.
-1	I would need to know how to determine the mass of each sample. I'd need to know what to lable the containers. I'd need to know how to preform the steps, not just what the steps are of the experiment.
1	Additional information that you will need in order to replicate the experiment was how much vinegar was put into container. How long do you rinse the samples ? Do the samples stay outside or inside ? Day or night ?
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they only eat one thing. Pandas eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus. They are both different from pythons because pythons habitat stretching from California to Delaware and including much of the south. Pythons can conceivably snacking their way up to Potomac.
-1	a.) Based on the data it seems type is amount stretched is the same. The other plastic types stretched differently on both trials. ^p b.) The students could run more trials to get a good result and they could measure the plastic after they put the clamps on the plastic and before they put the weights on.
-1	a) The percentage of the amount the plastic stretched was alot lower in the second trial than in the first. ^p b) They could have done more trials. They could have used more polymer plastics.
-1	I will need to add on them subtena by how many number their are. The sample has the amount of four layers it is to divide by eight.
1	"(a) Plastic type ""B"" is made of the stretchiest material. (b) It does not say how many or how heavy the weights added are causing the results to be innacurate. Also, the length is not the same for any trials or type of plastic."
-1	They should have said how much of each sample they put in each containor.
-1	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they can only survive in very special climates with specific food sources. These are different from pythons because pythons can adapt better and eat many different things. This is shown in the map provided with the article because it shows pythons could survive in 17 states.
-1	The pandas in  China and the koalas in audtralia are the same because they both only eat mostly one thing which for the panda its bamboo and for koalas its the eucalyptus leaves. The difference between those two & a python is pythons eat anything for an example a crocodile.
-1	The way the Chinease panda and the Australian koalas are alike is because they only eat one sorce of food, pandas only eat bamboo and koalas only eat eucalyptus leaves. On the other hand pythons eats mostly anything and everything it can.
-1	Additional information that would be needed for the procedure would be how someone find the mass of the samples and using what to find the mass, what are the samples;marble, limestone, wood and plastic and how to find the different in mass.
-1	Need to follow the procedure, also need to know them too.
-1	There is something missing. In the procedure it says to pour vinegar into the containers. What it fails to mention is how much vingar to pour into each container. Without this the experiment is impossible to replicate because the independent variable would be the amount of vinager added, but there is no mention of how much to add
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because both animals eat only one thing to survive. Pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. Both these animals are different from pythons because neither of them are a threat to biodiversity. They stay in one habitat. In the article it says that if anything can go anywhere then complications ensue.
-1	Tools.
-1	A) In conclusion, the student's data that was recorded showed plastic type B capable of stretching the most, than D, than C, & plastic type A stretched the least. ^p B) One way the students could have improved the experiment design/validity of the results would be by learning a hypothesis. Another thing that could be an improvement is if they varied the times the plastic hanged for up the amount of weight for each type.
1	Some plastics are stronger than others. ^p Added more weight. ^p Rock certeni brands of waiter bottets.
-1	China's panda are similar to Australias Koalas because they both have a strict diet and are picky paters. They are both different from pythons because a python will eat a lot more different food. Like the time when a python swallowed a n alligator and exploded in the Everglades in 2005.
-1	I would need vinegar, 4 containers, labels, time (24hours) a sink, 30 minutes for them to dry and a tripple beam ballance scale.
-1	Panda and koalas are similar by they eat greens. Pandas eat,bamboo and Koalas eat eucalyptus leaves. They are harmful and are sweet. They are both different to pythons by pythons are long, slim and dangerous and pandas & Koalas are fuzzy and harmless.
-1	The pandas in China and the koalas in Australia are both similar. The pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo and the koalas eat nothing but eucalyptus leaves. They are similar because of the fact that they both eat only one type of food. They are different from a python because a python eats alot of things. One python was caught eating an alligator and a Key largo wood rat.
-1	To repeat this experiment again, you would need to know the volume of vinegar you poured into the containers. The volume could each have to be equal to get the best results. Next, you would want to know the volume of the containers, so that you can assure that the next time you perform the experiment, you have the same results. Last, you would want to know the amount of distilled water you used, and the volume of the samples, so that you know that all the sample is submerged in vinegar.
-1	Some information you will need in order to replicate the experiment is things such as your hypothesis problem, results, conclusion, etc. You will also need to show how you got your results and conclusion.
-1	A:) If you hang weights on plastic type B then it will stretch at least 2-3 inchs. ^p B:) They could of told of what type of plastics they used and which one was the control.
-1	1). Get 4 different samples: marble, limestone, wood, plastic. ^p 2). Put each sample into 4 different containers. ^p 3). Pour vinegar in each of 4 separate but identical containers. ^p 4). After 24 hrs remove the samples from the container and rinse each w/ distilled water. ^p 5). Allow samples to sit and dry for 30 min. ^p 6). Determine the data of each sample. ^p 7). Record your data.
-1	The conclusion is most student plastic stretched more then others. They could improved the experiment by leaven the clips 30 mins.
1	To replicate this experiment you would need to know how many mls of vinegar to use. You would also need to know how much distilled water to rinse the samples with. To replicate this experiment you would need to know what type of containers to use to put the samples in. The type of samples also needs to be stated in the procedure not only in the results.
-1	Pandas and koalas are similar because they have the same eating habits and they don't move around much. Pandas and koalas differ from pythons because pythons cause harm & scare people and pandas/koalas eat very little and lovable.
1	You can came to a conclusion that plastic type B was the most stretchable for trial one it got 22mm and for trialz it got 25mm compared to the others that only got in the teens but 0 got 20mm both trials.
-1	Additional information needed to replicate this experiment can be a number of this. One important thing would be how much vinegar are you pouring in the containers. Without putting the same amount, it can change the mass of the samples. Another thing is in step three the material and what you are labling should be stated. How are you going to know what to label it as and what material it is.
-1	How much vinegar do you put in the cups ?
-1	Pandas in china are similar to koalas in Australia because both are specialist panda eat almost nothing but bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. Both pandas and koalas are different from pythons because they are generalist and can live anywhere.
-1	In their procedure, the studants weren't very clear on what the samples were. If they didn't have that table, I wouldn't have known what their samples were. They also didn't list all the materials they used for this experiment. So if I tried to repeat it, I could only guess the materials they used. These students also weren't very descriplive in the procedure. The way they worded some of the steps was very confusing. They needed to make it clearer.
-1	We had all the information we need to do the experiment, we allready know that wood is the one that has more mass out of all of them and that plastic is the least one but maybe if they would've explained it better to be able to complete the mass, because it looks like they only have estimates for the mass.
-1	After you determine the mass of the products, go back and see of your thesey was correct. Then go and daght a lab report about QV. Then when your done, hand it Qn.
1	After reading the groups procedure, additional information Ii would need in order to replicate the experience is; 1) Choose 4 different samples to work with. 2) Instead of pouring vinegar onto the samples use another liquid form. 3) And finally, instead of letting the samples sit and dry for 30 min, you can have them sit and dry for longer or shorter than 30 min.
-1	A) My conclusion is that the second trial went better than the first because the numbers are much larger than the first. ^P B) The first way is the students could have been more specific on what they did. And the seeena way is they should have said what types of plastics and tapes they was using.
-1	The additional information that I would need to replicate this experiment is the marble sample, the limestone sample and the wood sample, and the plastic sample. I would follow the procedure step by step.
-1	A) Based on the data as you see, different type of plastic they would be different or the same on both trials. For example plastic type A first. Trial is werent stretchable and when you repeat it again it would change. ^p B) Two ways to make it better was have more different plastics and maybe add more weight to the clamp to see what changes.
-1	Based on the students data you can conclude that plastic B is more durable than the rest of the plastics tested. Also that plastic A was the least durable out of the plastics. One way the students could improve their experiment is if they have at least 3 trials instead of just 2. Another thing the group could do to improve their experiment is to identify the independent and dependent variables in their procedure.
1	Three pieces of procedure would need to be further explained in order to replicate the experiment. First is how much vinegar should be alloted to each individual cup, as different amounts of the substance may have different effects on the samples. The next bit of info would be the size and shape of all samples, though the mass is given the surface area of each material is not. Third is the conditions that the cups must be put in during the 24 hour wait period. Should they be covered or placed in a concentrated environment ? Factors like this can have a large effect on the experiment.
1	Based on the students data I can conclude that plastic B stretches the most out of all the plastics. ^p b.) two ways the students could have improved this experiment is by being specific about the length of each piece of plastic. Another way they could have improved the experiment is by repeating the experiment.
-1	"In the first step the group needs to be more precise on what they are saying for example, the could say, ""Determine the mass of 4 different rock samples"". I also think they say sample too many times. You get confused about what they are saying. One last piece of additional information the need to put is how much vinegar to pour into the container."
-1	a) Plastic B stretched the most amount  therefore it is the most stretchabil. b) The students could have measured the length after 10 minutes instead of 5 minutes. They could have added more weights.
1	"Based upon the given data, I can conclude that plastic B had the most stretchability. The first thing the student needs to fix is in his experimental design, In step 4, (s)he says to ""add weight ..."" but they don't specify how much  weight to add. The next thing that needs to be fixed deals with validity. The student needs to record, the starting length of each plastic, as well as keep their length constant. ^p Say exat amount of weights to add record starting legnth of plastics."
-1	Panda's and koalas are both very similar because they are both decreasing in numbers pythons on the other hand are growing in the both at this moment, their numbers are increasing.
-1	Additional information you would need would be to put more time. A sample to write down the starting time & ending time, & try other samples next time.
-1	3/4 increased by 1, 1/4 decreased by 1 and 1/4 stayed the. ^p b.) Two ways of improving; ^p 1)Used a different weight for second trial. ^p 2) Or used four different types of plastic.
-1	The group would need to put in the materials, more information on what to do and add the measurement into be a good procedure.
-1	Find the difference in mass.
-1	Plastic type A was the only type of plastic that stretched the most. The student could of improved the experiment design by having two measuring devices. Also, they could of used heavier weights.
-1	In order to replicate the experiment, you would need a control such as water to compare the results to: You will need to know how much vinegar to include in the cup. You also will need to have an equal mass for equal mass for all of the samples. That is the additional information you need.
-1	Pandas and koalas are similar by their eating habits. Both species exclusively eat one thing. IN the article it says that pandas, eat almost nothing but bamboo and the koala eat eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. Panda and koalas differ from pythons by the pythons is a reptile and the others are mammals. In the passage it states that mammals are warm & fuzzy but snakes keep adapting to different environment.
-1	My opinion is to not change anything because it seems alright it has the 4 samples and the procedure presents the table.
-1	The additional information you will need to replicate this experiment is how much more of the needed samples you need, how much time you will need to go through with the procedure and what your starting mass needs to be.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they only eat 1 certain food. For example pandas eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves. They are different from pythons because they eat anything and can live anywhere where there is cold climate
-1	"Panda's in china are similar to koalas in Australia because they both only eat like plants/leaves it says that ""china pandas which eats almost nothing but bamboo or Australia's koalas which eats eucalyptus leaves. They are different from python because python's snakes and they eat alligator's because in the article theel was tryired to see if the alligators would eat the python and it end up the opposite the pythons ate the alligator instead."
-1	Additional information that is needed to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar is poured into the containers, how much material is needed into the container and how much of the samples do I need.
-1	The students sould had said what type of plastic they used and if they were the same, and say what was the main reason for us to no how much a the plastic streched.
1	a.) A conclusion I can draw from the experiment is that that plastic type B has the most stretchability because it stretched the greatest amount of mm which wass 22mm in trial 1 and 23mm in trial 2. ^p b.) The student could improve this experiment by specifying a certain length all polymer plastics should start out as so they all begin on the same level and therefore the data is accurate. Also, the student could specify how many milimeters of each plastic should be taped to the table so they all start put the same length & make the data more accurate.
1	To replicate the experiment you would need to know the kind of word used. you should also need to know how long you would have to rinse the samples in the distilled water.  The size of the container would be essential as well, so you would know how much vinegar should be used.
-1	After reading the data I have concluded that plastic type B is the stretches. One out of four types. I concluded that type b is the best because when you add up the numbers from T1& T2 for each number type B has 45mm. So it is the longest on.
1	After reading the group  procedure the additional information I would need to replicate the experiment is what material are are the 4 different samples make of it is not listed in the procedure,how much vinegar should I pour in each container more or less could affect how much mass has ended ,what shape the sample were in in shape with there surface, we would have  more contact with  the vinegar, ending It RIGHT   and the mass  of the starting material if it was to replicate to experiment or repeat the exactly i would need   know  how much of each sample was used.
-1	All of the plastics stretched, plastic A stretched the least, plastic B stretched the most.^p 2 ways the student could of improved the experimental design is by doing a 3rd trial and also saying how much weight was added.
-1	In conclusion all the plastic types are all different amount stretched. The plastic stretching out in trials 1-2 are going up and down. ^p The student could have improved by doing a third trial to show more of the results. Explain why they added more weight.
-1	If I replicated this I would also need what I uses acid rain in measuring the  container masses and how the acid rain would effect
-1	To replicate the experiment, I'd need to know how much Vineger to pour into each sample. I'd also need to know what to lable each sample and how much rain to put in each cup.
-1	I will need to know what's the purpose for this experiment, know the difference in mass for each sample, and I need to know an esimate of what they thought the starting and ending mass was.
-1	The following additionnl information I would put is record the difference in mass after the beginning and ending of each mass.
-1	In order to deplicate this experiment, you would need to state exectly how much of a certain chemicals you need to pour. In most cases, it is imperative that you get the right amount of a substance or your results may be difficient.
1	A) From this data, it can be concluded that plastic type B is the most flexible because it has the longest length stretched in both trial 1 and 2 additionally. Plastic type A is the least flexible since it had the shortest length stretched in both trials. B) One way the experimental design could be improved is by adding more trials for each plastic because more trials lead to more accurate results. Additionally the design could show how much weight is used on each plastic because if the weights are not the same for each plastic and trial, the results are clearly not valid.
-1	In this experiment you need to know the starting mass of all 4 samples and the ending mass of all of them. You may also need to know that they were soaked in vinegar for 24 hours. What would that do to the samples.
1	In conclusion plastic type B stretched the most while A and C were approximately the same. D stayed the same for both trials (20mm).^p The students could have preformed a 3rd trial with the plastic type. Also they could have let the plastics hang longer than 5 minutes.
1	a) Plastic type B can stretch the most, while A has the most tensile strength because it streched the least. ^p b) The student could have improved their design by having the plastic be the same lenghth for each plastic. For example each could be a foot long. A second change would be to put the same amount on each plastic, for example each could have a lag weight.
1	A) I would conclude that plastic A is the strangest because it didn't stretch as much as plastics B, C or D. ^p B) One thing the student's could have done to improve their experiment is include exactly how much weight they put on each clamp so it could eaisy repeated and eaiser to understand. Another thing they can do is do a third trial for more accurate results.
-1	A. To conclude, the polymer plastics went through four trials. The data shows that A was averaged to 11, B was averaged to 22.5, C was averaged to 13.5, and D stayed at 20. The plastic type B stretched to most. I predict that if they did a 3-rd trial the numbers would be close. ^p B. The students could of improved if they let the plastic hang for 10 minutes and maybe the results wouldn't be so close. Also, add more details to the procedure.
-1	I would have 4 container caled the 4s marble, limestar wood and plastic so the readers can know whats in the containers then poured a even amount of vinegar on each samee. Let it sit & dry out for 24 hours & deterime the mass I got at the end culd compared it to the mass I got in the begeing vig.
-1	You would need to tel what type of samples they are. Also, what type of untensil to use to measure the mass of the samples. Also, would need repeat or replicating trials to re-test the experiment. Or you ll also need to tell what to label the containers by in this experiment, you 'll also need to reach the mass or how each sample looks by using your five senses, or whatever or not to make a data same to show your results.
-1	Based on the data. I can see that most of the plastic wraps either stayed the same or increased on the length stretched out. I can say the weights did have an impact on how long it stretched out to be overall, it was a good experiment w/ information, but there could've been improvements. Next time I would recommend trying different weights to see if the amount of weight will determined the length. Also, we can add more time to how long the weights stays on the plastic.
-1	a) A conclusion based on the students data would be that plastic B is the strongest. Out of all the plastic at 22mm. In the first trial had 23mm in the second trial, because it stretch more than all the other. ^p B) Two the student could have improved the experimenting and / or validity of the result are to add new types of plastics and add more trials to the containers.
-1	To replicate this experiment additional information you would need is a time chart to keep track of time.
1	Based on the students data; plastic type B has the highest stretchability at 45mm stretched, while plastic type A would be the worst at only 22mm stretched. ^p Two ways the students could have improved their data are, one; They could say how heavy the weights were and maybe allowed them to hang on the clamps for more than 5 minutes. Two; They could have had more than 2 trials.
-1	Panda's in china are similar to koalas bears in Australia in a way because  they are both specialists.This means that they have to be in an environment that supports their specific needs, lik an abudance of bamboo or eucalyptus. Python are different because, as generalist, the can thrive in many similar environments.
1	"In order to replicate the experiment one would need additional info that the group left out of their procedure. The group needs to include the problem, a hypothesis of what they're testing, materials ""they need to"""" perform the experiment, and a conclusion that analyses their data and states wether their hypothesis was wrong or right. The group also needs to list the amount of each sample used so that can remain a constant not a variable changed."
-1	To replicate the acid rain experiment, the group would have to include, how much vinegar to pour into the containers, what the starting mass of each rock should be and the amount of water the samples are rinsed with.
-1	A) My conclusion based on the students data is that plastic type A is the one that stretches the most. ^p B) Two things the student could of did to make his experiment better is, one tell us how much the weights weighed and two tell us the plastic types of polymer be used.
1	You need to know the amount of vinegar that you have to pour in the four separate containers. You also need to know what size container you are putting the sample in. Also, you need to know what temperature you leave the samples to sit and dry at for 30 min.
1	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how big of a container to use (what it should be able to hold), how much vinegar to pour into each container ( how many ml ), what type of vinegar, what to weigh the samples on (bathroom scale or type of beam balance, maybe electronic?).
-1	Some additional information they could have added be how much vinegar should be pourred into each container, tell how much material they used in each container, and stated if there hypothesis was true.
-1	The three samples of information would need to replicate the experiment are measurements of the amount of vinegar, the materials you would need to use and purpose of the experiments.
1	(a) Based on the students data, plastic type B is the 'stretchiest' plastic. ^p (b) Make all original lengths equal I add the same weights (undefined in the procedure). Find a way besides tape to hold the plastic.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia, is they both rely on their food source, if one's food source was gone the species would be extinct. Both differ from their location and climate change. Pythons are cold blooded animals who can move from place to place.
1	A. It seems that in 11 the most ductile polymes is plastic type B at 22cm. For 12 it is again plastic type B at 33cm. So it seems type B polymes is the ductule polymes. ^p ^p B. To better enhance the results of the polymer expirement then shouldue incuid the length of tht polymes unstreched.
-1	They need to measure the amount of vinegar and only put in one container. You need to measure the mass clearly not just estimate. You get the mass before you do anything to it.
-1	Pandas In China are similar to Koalas in Australia because there both specialist the difference between them 2 is panda eat almost nothing but bamboo while Australia Koalas eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively There both different from pythons is with the assistance of teachers pythons can live anywhere from Florida to Australia
-1	If the students test out the four different plastic stretchability then add weights to the clamps on the bottom of the plastic and wait 5 minutes, they will come to the conclution that plastic that plastic B is the most stretchable plastic B's results the first time was 22 $ the second time 23. The second most stretchable is plastic D which was 20 then 20. So in closing the students found if they put weights on the 4 different type of plastic and wait 5 minutes then repeat that, plastic B is the most stretchable.
1	Based on the students data, I can conclude that plastic type A is the most durable.^p Two ways the student could have improved this experiment would be to clearify how much weight was added to each plastic and to measure the plastic before he/she stretched it.
-1	"Panda's in China and koala's in Australia are similar because they are both specialists. Also a panda ""eats nothing but bamboo"" and a koala ""eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively"". They each only eat one plant. They are different from pythons because pythons are generalists and they are not quite as picky; they eat multiple things and other animals."
-1	The pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both eat nothing but bamboo. But the difference between the pythons is that they are in Asia inhabit climates that are similar to those in about a third of the continental United States.
1	You need to know how much vinegar to put in each container, what and of container to use and whether to react the samples or not.
1	The additional information that should be included in this procedure is. How much vinegar goes in each sample. Where do the samples go to sit and dry at. Label the samples in the procedure too not just in the data.
-1	3 pieces of information I would include to replicate ths procedure would be to pour less vinegar in each container, let samples sit and dry for 30 min and leave samples for 20 hours. I choose that to see if anything different would happen to the mass then what happened to it the first time they tried this experiment.
1	The conclustion of this lab according to the students, data type B of the plastic is the weakest and type A of the plastic is the strongest. For the plastic C and D, they are inbetween and C is close to A. The student could have improved the experiment by; saying the measurement of the plastic and how much mass the was on earth peice of plastic. Another way to improve the experiment is making sure the temperature is kept constant and that no one touches the plastic.
1	Plastic type B stretched the longest out of plastic A, C, and D. On the first try streching 22mm and the second time streching 23mm. To make the experiment better the student should have done the experiment a couple more times because plastic type D streched 20mm both times. The second way he or she could make it better is by telling how much weight he added on the clamp.
-1	China's panda which eats almost nothing but bamboo or Australia's koala bear which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively but they are specialist.
-1	Additional information I would need is how much vinegar was put onto each sample. This is because, if more vinegar is put on one sample than another it will most likely after the mass in different ways: for example if more vinegar is put on wood than plastic then wood will have more mass lost than the plastic would.
-1	The group didn't say what the samples are for their experiment in the procedure. They also should have say how much vinegar would be poured into each container. They should tell how much of each sample would be used in each container.
-1	Based on the student data it shows that T2 and T1 are showing that most of the experiments change on the second trial, and a couple stayed the same as the first trial. ^P The students could have improved their experiment by listing what the type of plastic is on the graph. They also showed have wieghed each weight to make sure they are all the same. They also could have hung the wights from the same distance on the plastic.
1	The group of students needs to add how big or small the containers should be. Another item that the students did not add was how much vinegar goes in each container. The group also forgot to mention what samples they are using. Without these 3 main information points, nobody could replicate this lab.
-1	"A- In conclusion, plastic type ""B"" streched the most. The data says, it streched 22mm on trial one and 23mm on trial 2. ^p B- One way the student could change the procedure, is allow them to hang for 10 min instead of 5 minutes. Also they could change it up by, changing the weights every time."
1	There are several things this group should have included, in their procedure. They did not specify what type of container or how large. They did not say what type of vinegar or how much to pour into the container. They did not say what to do with the container when you finish. They did not specify how  they determined the mass.
-1	To repeat the experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar to put into the containers, you  would used to know the purpose of the experiment and what the difference is mass says about the samples.
-1	In order to duplicate the experiment I would also need to know what were the samples being used, what king of containers I need (size). I would also need the information that tells me to measure the starting mass of each sample.
-1	A) Plastic type B is easily the most sufficient plastic because it had the highest measurements for both trials. ^p B) 1.They could of easily measured for more time. This way they could see how much more it could stretch. 2. They could of had one more trial usually an experiment has 3 trials. This way average will be more precise.
1	a. I conclude that plastic B is the strongest with an average stretch length of 22.5 mm. Plastic A is the least stretchiest with an average of 11 mm. Plastic D is the second stretchiest with an average of 20 mm, and plastic C is the third with 13.5 mm as the average. ^p b. 1) They could have had a constant beginning plastic length. ^p 2) They could have had a standard weight of the weight and tried stretching with heavier or lighter weight for a 3rd trial to see how the weight affects the polymer.
-1	To replicate this experiment, you would need to know what samples to use. It does not state what samples were used until the data table was shown.
-1	What type of marble, limestone, wood, and plastic did they used?
-1	The pandas and koalas are similar to each other because the panda only eats bamboo and the koala only eats eucalyptus leaves. The python eats several types of foods and can adapt better than the panda or koala.
1	Which material you are using for the experiment, also record their masses before the vineger and also when it's in the vinegar. You also might want to mass the cup filled with vinegar to see how much grams it had gained with the material.
1	Based on the students data it shows that plastic type A had the highest stretch constance to the weights pulling on it. In the two trials it only stretched 10 and 12mm while the next best stretched 13 and 14. One way to improve their experiment is to have performed a third trial. Although their test two were similar to end results the third trial would only have made it more valid definitely proving their results are correct. Another way is to specify how heavy the weights are and what type of plastic is being used. Then the reader would know exactly what you're doing in the experiment, and it'd give a better understanding.
-1	Plastic D has no stretchability. It stayed the same both trial kinds. ^P The students could of improved there experiment by putting a time for trial 2. Also giving an exact amount of weight that should be added to the plastic.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they only eat one type of food. Pandas only eat bamboo and koalas only eat eucalyptus leaves. They are both different from pythons because pythons can eat just about anything because when it went to a new habitat, it didn't die. This is because it didn't need food it had from old habitat to survive.
-1	In the procedure, the group of students said to pour vinegar in each of four containers. However, the students failed to state how much vinegar should be added. By not doing so one could try the experiment as the procedure says to but may get different results because the amount of vinegar that he or she used may be different from the students' amount. Also, there needs to three trials of each of the samples and a clear explanation as to how the mass of the samples was found.
-1	The additional information that the group did not add in,  was how much viniger was poured in each container. If each container had different mass of viniger, then it will affect the out come of the samples. You must have the same amount of viniger in each container and must be done at the right time to get the lab as accurate as possible.
-1	The first thing the students should improve the experiment design is instead of attaching clamps to the bottom of the plastic sample they should use small boots to it. Then the second thing they should  is do more trials to the experiment because they probaly won't be happy with the data they already got so I would say do more trials and they might get better results.
-1	I think that if this group that did the acid rain. Investigation should of recorded the temp. of the vinegar and cleared it if it was the right amount , so they didn't tell the amount of vinegar and the staff that happened that happened after they let the samples sit and dry.
1	"a.) Based on the students data, plastic type ""B"" was the most stretchable of the tested plastic. ^P b.) One improvement would be keeping the starting length them same & stating it. Second would be the amount of weight attached at each intervals."
-1	the first thing the procedure needs to specific measurements the second thing it needs to identify each material. And the third thing is they need a controlled.
-1	One thing missing from this experiment is the percise measurement of vinegar pour experiment. You would also need to have the samples all the same size. Thirdly, you need to know the size of the container when repeating this experiment.
-1	In order to replicate this experiment, you would first need to know how much (volume or mml) you would need to pour into the containers. Also, you would need to know how much specifically you would need to rinse the containers.Nothing B messed up in the experiment. And step 5 does not explicate how to d it, does the experiment want the containers to have the same area, it does not explicate.
-1	A) In conclusion, plastic type A stretched 2mm more in the second than in the first trial. Plastic type B stretched 1mm more in the second trial than in the first. Plastic type C stretched 1mm more in the second trial than in the first trial. Plastic type D stretched the same amount in both trials.^p B) To improve the validity the group could have stated how much weight to use and had more tests and trials.
1	The additional information that is needed in the procedure is they should state what samples are going to be used. Also, they should include how much vinegar we need to pour into the container because different amounts could have different results. Lastly, It should include the size of the container because it could have a different result.
1	mRNA leaves the nucleus of the cell to begin protein synthesis. From the nucleus the first step includes the mRNA attatching to the rough endoplasmic reticulum in the form of ribosomes. The second step is for the mRNA to be copied to tRNA. tRNA is a complimentary copy to mRNA. The third step,the tRNA is copied into a complimentary rRNA.The codons are read and ready for synthesis. The fourth step includes the assembly of the protein, beginning with a start amino acid and ending with a stop amino acid.
-1	The conclusion would be that the plastic in trial2 was stretchies for the most part trial 1. Two ways they could have improved this experiment would be to repeat the procedure with different plastic and put it at different temperatures.
-1	In order to replicate the experiment i belive that the information wanted would be the starting rows, ending mass, and difference in mass. The additional information in my opinion would be how the structure changed throughout the procedure.I f you were to record this data at because the procedure would be successful to see the difference on mass in four samples
1	To replicate this experiment, you would need to know the volume of the vinegar in the cup, the temperature of the surroundings, and the exact acidity of the vinegar on the ph scale.
1	Based on the data table plastic. Types A, B, C and  D. Plastic A was the weakest because it stretched 22 mm to 23 mm. The student could have made this experimental better if the do more trail and the temperature of the plastic.
-1	The additional info I would need to replicate it is, marble, limestone, wood, plastic, water, container, vinegar, label.
-1	After reading this group's procedure, I found that they left out the amount of vinegar that was added to each cup. This information is vital because if this experiment were to be replicated the results would vary among other replications from the original test, the data obtained from a replication of this experiment it would be false and the procedure couln't be replicated. Therefore, it is clear that the amount of vinegar poured in each cup is vital information to this experiment.
-1	"Pandas and koalas are similar by they both get along around people. For example, the article says ""species that have become most abundant are often those that do best in and around humans."" Unlike pythons the panda and koala are in abundants. so they do the best in and around people."
-1	What we need is two determine the mass of the samples and the label and they reely need to rinse it more.
-1	"Pandas in china are similar to koalas in Australia because they are specialists as they are different from the python because the python is a generalists. There are more pythons because the word today ""favors generalists rather than specialists"" says one sentence in the article."
1	plastic type B has the highest stretchability as it stretched 22 and 23mm, the furthest. Plastic type A is the least stretchable it only stretched 10 and 12mm, the least out of all. This experiment would be more validif the student had 3 trials instead of only 2, to rule out any problems. The student should have also specified the amount constant length of plastic.
-1	"Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia but are both different from pythons. Pandas and koalas are both vegetarians and the panda eats almost nothing but bamboo while the koala eats eucalyptus leaves as stated in the article. Also stated in the article, ""mammals are warm and fuzzy; but animals such as lizards and snakes tend, at least in this culture, to be less well respected or supported."" In the Everglades in 2005: A python swallowed an alligator which makes the python a carnivore."
-1	First you need vinegar. You must put some in four containers then place a sample of one material into one container and label. Then after 24 hours rinse each sample with water. After that let them dry and determine the mass of each sample.
-1	After reading this procedure i think it would need task needed. Tell what it is you are doing and what solution, and a hypothesis.
1	"a) A conclusion to the experiment could be that ""plastic type B was able to be stretched the most (22mm, 23mm) when compared to the stretchability  of the after three plastics. ^P b. One way the students could have improved the experiment would be to add in the conclusion the amount of weight they add up to each tag. They could have improved validity by adding another trial."
-1	In the passage, paragraph 19-21, I explains generalists and specialists. Generalists can live anywhere and adapt to any place. Humans are the biggest generalists for example, but pythons are in this category too. Specialists are the opposite. They cant survive in many places because they cant adapt. Koala bears eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively, and China's panda bear eats just only bamboo. They  need those in.
-1	Some additional information for their procedure would be to use the same amount of vinegar for each container. Also make sure the times are all on for each sample. Also measure the mass after it drys and find your difference from its starting mass.
-1	For both trials they had similar results. They could have improved their experiment by adding more weights instead of keeping them the same.
-1	"Koalas and pandas are similar because they are both specialists. According to the article, specialists are better with stability. The koala and panda eat the same food always and live in the same habitat constantly while a python, a generalist, can change and adapt even when  ""man kind has chosen to make earth a rapidly changing place."
-1	In this procedure I would of also mentioned weighing the rocks, I would at stated how much vinegar you pour in each container and I would of listed how to find the mass.
-1	Plastic B is the most stredechable and A is the least stredachable.^p They should vary the weights they had on this elome and also allow them to hens for longer.
1	You would also need to know what kind of object you used for each material, for example plastic could
-1	In order for or to replicate the experiment, the chart needs to show every pice of the experiment like what hapend when you put Vinegar on four separate pices but identical containers, on how you put one pice of of material in one container and label them the doing the with the remaining samples one pice of material in one container for all of it each. By showing all the data then you'll be able to replicate the experiment.
-1	China's panda and Australia's koala are similar because they are both bears, they both are specialist, and they both focus on eating one food' panda's is bamboo, as koala's is eucalyptus. The panda bear and koala bear both differs from the cobra because the cobra's a generalist as the panda bear and koala bear is not.
-1	Panda in china and koalas are both similar because they both only eat one thing. like China panda eats bamboo And Australias koal eats only eucalyptus.
-1	"China pandas and Australia koala bears are both specialist. And they are different from pythons because pythons are generalist. The article state that a generalist is ""racoon, a python, a cockroach and a white tail deer."""
1	First, the mRNA goes to a ribosome.  It connects with the ribosome and then tRNA comes and connects with the ribosome.  The tRNA reads the mRNA and pairs anticodons with the codons from the mRNA.  This forms an amino acid.  This continues to happen until you have a long chain of amino acids and the mRNA tells the tRNA to stop decoding.
-1	Pandas are similar to koalas due to their very much a like eating habitsthey both eat bamboo and occasional bugs. Pythons on the other hand, aren't mammals like pandas & koalas & eat mostly rodents.
-1	1) How much of each sample should i use to replicate the experiment. ^p 2) How much vinegar should i use when replicating the experiment. ^p 3) What should i use to determine the mass in my experiment.
1	In order to be able to recreate this experiment I would need to know what is in the cups. I am assuming that it was same type of acid, because the marble lost 4g, the limestone lost 1.3g and the plastic lost 1g. The acid in the cups would have eaten away at the materials, and different acids have different rates of corrosion, so I would need to know what acid acid and its pH in order to recreate this experiment
1	In order to replicate this experiment thoroughly, one would need to know the approximate size of each sample, as a 10 inch block of wood and a 10cm block would react differently. Also, are would need to know how how much  vinegar to put in each cap and what the conditions of the room were when you leave the samples for 24 hours.
1	According to the results shown on the table I can conclude that the plastic type B is the most stretchable. Type B stretched the most at 23 mm. Type D stretched 20mm while type C stretched 14mm. Type A only stretched 12 mm. There are many ways that the group could have improved their design. One thing the could have shown is the initial length of the plastic. Also the group could have shown how much weight they added to the clamps. This would allow me to reproduce their experiment and compare results.
-1	Limestone you would need because it's the most important of then it won't work when you used it.
1	First, you would need to know what materials to use as samples. Second, you would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container. Lastly, you would need to know what conditions to keep the containers at.
-1	"Pandas & koalas are similar because they both are classified as specialist & they both eat plants. While the pythons are generalist that eat meat & animals. According to the article it states ""a python swallowed an alligator & which eats almost nothing but bamboo."" These 2 auntes show how both animal have diffrent traits, & eatinhabits are just one of them."
-1	Based on the student's data, plastic D stretched the same length for both trials. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design would be to on the data table, say how long each type of plastic is before the student started the experiment. Another way the student could of improved the experimental design would be to have done only one trial instead of two.
1	a) Plastic type B has the most stretchability in all plastic samples, and plastic type A has the least. b). He could repeat the lab more and increase variables tas.
-1	The panda from China and the kola from Australia are similar because they are both specialist. These two animals are different from pythons because pandas and koalas are only found in one area on the world. Where as the python is found across the world in many different contents and countries.
1	A. In conclusion Plastic B was the best because it had the highest amount stretched for both trials in the first it stretched 22 while A,10, C 14, D 20 the second trial that it went up a mm to 23 while A,12,C,13, D 20. ^p One way they could improve the validity is more trials your experiment will only get more valid with more trials. The second way is to be more specific with what trials with what kind of tape, how much tape your using and were you measuring from weather it's the whole thing or just the part hanging.
-1	Based on the data table I would say that plastic D was your strongest plastic, because it didn't stretch. One way they could of improved the experiment was to run a trial 3 to tell plastic D. Another way they could of improved the experiment is by adding many weights.
-1	The conclusion is that the plastic did stretched out but some stayed the same length and other decreased. ^p The student would have improved is by having a control group by doing it by a certain weight and other put more weight see if there any difference in ti stretchability.
1	In order to replicate th experiment the students will need to add 5 things. What type of woods, plastic, limestone and marble so for example th wood thy use is hard than the wood you use. How much vinegar needs to be poured in it enough to cover it or not. Also what siz container. Another thing to change how long is each sample rinsed for so some don't absorb more or less water. And finally what temperature does th samples dry at because in higher or lower temperatures or humid environments th samples may dry at a different speed.
-1	The group's procedure is wrong because they need more time on doing this experiment and if the group just work a little more harder than they did before, then they still have a chance at passing the experiment by taking out the marble and limestone and replacing them with paper or something different, then they can pass the experiment by taking some bad material out and putting new material in.
1	After reading the group procedure, the additional information needed is the name of the four different samples. The group does not say what they are, also one ober not but needs to know the site of each sample another pieces of information needed has much vinegar should be poured into each container. The group also needs to put into there procedure what measurement they should and call use to weight the mass of each sample.
-1	Both pandas in China and Koalas in Australia are similar because the panda eats almost nothing but bamboo and Koala eats almost nothing but eucalyptus leaves.
1	THe three types are diffusion, facilitated diffusion, and active transport. Diffusion doesn't use energy to move substances. The movement will always go from high concentration of the substance to low concentration. Once the concentration of the substance reaches equilibrium, or is the equal, the substance will move back and forth equally.A specific type of diffusion is osmosis, the diffusion of water. Facilitaed diffusion is used to transport substances that canot go through te semipermeable cell membrane. It uses no energy because it still diffusion. It uses the channel protiens in the cell membrane so that the substance can pass through. Active transport is used when a substance goes from low to high concentration. This type of transportation does use energy because it 'goes against the flow.' It is used when a cell need to take in nutrients or get rid of waste.
-1	In order to replicate this expirement, you would need to know how much vinegar to put in each cup. Different amounts of vinegar would add another variable to the expirement , compromising the results.
-1	Koalas and pandas are similar. They both only are pretty much one food source. They are both specialists. In the article it says, the python however is a generalist and can survive in many different environment like the Everglades.
-1	In order to replicate the experiment, you would need additional information like how much vinegar was poured into the separate containers, what tools to use such as safety goggles, and having more trials.
-1	I would need the information of why you would let the different samples dry out of the containers. And what are they drying into?
-1	"Both Pandas and Koalas are defined as specialist species, while pythons are defined as general species. What makes them different is their ability to adapt. ""The Ultimate generalist is/arguably, a human being, who with the assistance of technology can live anywhere."" (Achenbech) The author included the fact to help the reader understand genera and specialist species. The panda and Koala are similar because they only eat a certain thing and and the only in one habitat, while the pythons lives mostly anywhere."
1	To replicate the groups procedure, you would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each container. You would also need a control, which would be all the sample in water and you would need to know where to keep the samples and what environment they should be left in.
-1	A. It seems that seems that most of the bags stretched a little more in the second trial. ^p B. I think the student could have improved this experiment by doing more trials.
-1	The similarities between China's panda which eats almost nothing but bamboo compared to a koala bear, which eats eucalyptus leaves. Is that all they eat is plants. Both panda and koala compared to different pythons is that they all eat animals.
-1	Pandas in china are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both herbivors they are both different from  a python because a python is a carnivors able to swallow alligators and can breeds or double almost anywhere.
1	A conclusion I can draw is that plastic type B can be streched the most at 22 mm. Plastic type A was the weekest stretched at 10 mm. ^p Two ways are do a control and do it for a longer time.
-1	A) They should remain the same.^p B) They should take out the weights.^p C) They should work together on the project.
-1	The additional information needed in order to replicate the experiment is to have a control for each of the four different samples, also measure the amount of vinegar being poured and 24 hours exactly being washed.
1	(a) Based on the results you can tell that plastic type B can hold the most weights and plastic type A can hold the least weight.^p (B) Two ways the students could improve the experiment was to do three trials for an accurate results and have every thing the same measurement to also be accurate.
-1	I would need to know how much samples I need for this experiment. I would need to know how much vinegar I am pouring into each container. Also, I would need to know if I am letting the samples dry in the sun or not. Without these, I could not replicate this experiment.
-1	Three aditional peace of information you need is what typ of vinegar and at what PH. Also the lb of the samples.
1	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar was poured into the containers, and I'd also need to know what the volume of the separate but identical, containers were I would also need to know how much water (distilled) was used to rinse off the samples, and for how long did the students rinse the samples, I may also need to know with what in statement the samples were massed in order to replicate the experiment.
-1	The pandas in China are similar to the koalas in Australia because they both have both exclusive diets. Meaning they only eat things like bamboo or eucalyptus leaves. Those animals differ from the python because the python can adapt its diet to wherever it is living.
-1	The conclusion is that the plastic B is the largest one in trial 1 & in trial 2. 30 plastic B is  the longest plastics out of all of the plastic style. the two ways to make experiment would be adding more trials and also having the plastic & weights hang for a longer time.
1	After I read the groups procedure, I determined that you need to know how much vinegar to pour in the contain in step 2. Another piece of information you need is what type of vinigar you need. The last piece of information you need is what size container should you use.
-1	"The additional information I would need to radicate the experiment I would explain the look of the outcome of the experiment. I would put ""After 24 hours, remove the samples from the container & rinse each sample w/ distilled water. ""Allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes. Instead of putting ""Determine the mass of each sample"". I would tell you the outcome on what happened and how the experiment turned out."
1	A conclusion that can be made based on the data is that plastic type A is the strongest. This is ture because plastic A stretched the least about on average. Two ways that the students could have improved their lab is by saying how long the types of plastic should be and saying how many weights should be added to the clamp and how many weights should be added to the clamp because there could have been an error when the plastics were different lengths with different amounts of weights and this would make the data inaccurate.
-1	A. Based on the data I conclude plastic D is the stretchiest type of plastic. In both trials the plastic stretched the same amount (20mm) ^p B. One way the students could have improved the experiment was to record anything that went wrong.  Another way was to create a graph.
1	After mRNA leaves the nucleus, it enters into the cytoplasm, where it docks at a ribosome made of rRNA. Next, tRNA reads the codons and using its anticodons goes out into the cytoplasm to pick up the amino acid that corresponds. It then travels back to the mRNA and connects its amino acid with the one previously set before it. Once the tRNA reaches the stop codon, the polypeptide chain is released and a protein has formed.
1	From this experiment, I would need to know how big each of the containers are, I would also like to know how much vinegar was placed in each container If I was to replicate this experiment. I would also need to know how long to rinse off the samples with distilled water after this has been removed from their containers.
1	In order to replicate the experiment, I need to know how much vinegar I should put into the four seperate containers. I would also need to know what temperature. I should place the containers while they sit for 24 hours. I would need to know where I should place the containers too, for example, in light, in dark place, or have it exposed to sunlight.
-1	To replicate this experiment, you would need to know how many ml of vinegar is poured into each container. You would also need to know how much distilled water was supposed to be poured onto the samples. Also, you may want to have the starting mass of each samples be the same.
-1	In order needs say the information.
-1	Pandas and koalas are similar animals, although a python is completely different. Both pandas and koalas are specialist animals, this means they have to live in a certain climate and eat certain foods to survive. They differ from pythons because pythons because pythons are generalist animals, which means it has a more general food source. Overall koalas and pandas differ from pythons.
1	When the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it fits through the holes by virtue of being single-stranded. The mRNA floats around until it encounters a ribosome. The ribosome latches on to the mRNA with the larger portion nesting with and reading three nitrogenous bases, called a codon, at a time. The ribosome says in semi-stasis until a tRNA with the proper corresponding nitrogenous bases bumps into it. The tRNA is held by the ribosome until the second codon has been read, and a second tRNA is bonded to by the Ribosome. A peptide (dehydration synthesis) bond forms between the two amino acids, and the initial tRNA is 'cut loose' The ribosome then moves on down the mRNA creating the protein coded for. A strand of mRNA can be translated several times.
-1	"China's panda eats almost nothing but bamboo. The koala eats eucalyptus leaves. They both don't eat meat. Pythons eat almost anything. ""A python swallowed an alligator."" As said in the article, pandas and koalas eat plants and pythons can eat anything."
1	We would need to know how much vinegar the students used in the experiment. We would also need to know what kind of container they used. These two bits of information are important to know so that we can make sure that the replication samples were covered with vinegar the same as the original. We would also need to know the dimensions of the samples because a change in surface area would greatly alter the experiment (for if an object has a higher surface area to volume ratio, it will dissolve more quickly than a sample with a lower ratio). Lastly, we need to know the concentration of the vinegar.
-1	"Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists & can only eat one type of food. According to the article Chinese pandas ""eat almost nothing but bamboo"" and Australian koalas ""eat eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively."" This means they can only survive in environments with that certain food. On the other hand, the article says that pythons are generalists, and can therefore adapt to almost any environment."
-1	A python swallowed an alligator and there's not a delicate way to pot it exploded. Pythons in Asia inhabit climates that are similar to those in about a third of ths continental United States.
-1	We would need observations during the whole experiment , maybe repeats of the experiment to see if anythings changed. Also try another sample.
1	Based on the student's results, polymer B was able to stretch the furthest length being 22mm in trial one and 23mm in trial two. ^p Two ways that the student could improve the experimental design is by specifying in the procedure the weight of each weight, and by performing an additional trial.
-1	The two ways the student could have improved the experimental design is Repeat the procedure exactly for the remaining three plastic samples.
-1	Panda in China and Koalas from Australia are they same because they both eat healthy like plants. Like the panda eats bamboo as the Koala eats eucalyptus leaves. They're different from pythons because they eat plants while pythons eat meat, such as mices.
-1	In conclusion, the strongest plastic that held up is plastic type B. In trail one was statend 22mm and trail; two was 23mm, while plastic type A got 10mm for the first trail and 12mm for the second trail. So over all the plastics, type B  is the one that can hold up the longest and is more durable. One way this lab could do is to add more trails. Then another improvement could be to explain exly in the produre to get three more bags.
-1	Additional information that is needed to be able to replicate the experiment would be to know how much vinegar is being poured into the different yet identical containers.
-1	"Pandas in China and koalas are different from pythons because as it states in the article, ""China's panda which eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's koala bear which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively"", whereas; pythons can eat animals such as alligators. Not only is what they at a difference, but pythons are generalists, and the panda and koala are specialists."
-1	Panda bears in China, and koala bears in Australia is similar because they are both environmental species. They both different from python because a python is a generalist.
-1	Need an exeirimental desier staldhs the hypothics title and IV and ov.
-1	In order to replicate the experiment the procedure needs to be more specific. It would need to tell how much vinigar is used in the containers, have a longer drying time because the samples will not be fully dry after 30 minutes and say what the samples are weighed with. It is also important that safety procautions are told such as gloves or goggles.
-1	First, I woule Say you need to get all materials before you do any of that. What would we use to get the masses of the 4 different materials and where woule we place the 4 containers while we are waiting for the results.
-1	They need to repeat every step that already preformed.
-1	The panda's and koala's are similar because they are both specialist species eating almost exclusivly one form of plant type and they are both different from pythons because a python is a generalist species eating almost any animals it can so it is not limited to one habitat or region.
-1	1. I would have to know what kind of area I would have to leave it in for 24 hours. (temperature) ^p 2. I would have to know what kind of wood to use, if there has any specific. ^p 3. Also in step 6, it does not say what I have to use to determine the mass of the rocks, plastic and wood.
-1	The conclusion
1	The mRNA enters the ribosome. It then begins translation when the anticodons from the tRNA match up with the codons on the mRNA. The starting codon is always Met. As the tRNA attaches to the mRNA, the amino acids above them form peptide bonds. Finally, the last step is the stop codon on the mRNA. This signals the end of protein synthesis.
-1	I would need to know what materials i am getting to begin this experiment. What should i be looking for when experiment is going on? How do i determine the mas of each sement.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia. Panda eat almost nothing but bamboo or Australia koala bear which eat eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. They are both different from pythons because the species have become most abandunt are often those that do best in and around humans.
-1	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know what the different mauterials were. I would also need to know how many different materials there were and what the starting mass of each material was.
1	After mRNA leaves the nucleus, after going through the process of trancription where the RNA polymerase unzip the strand into two identical halves, the mRNA goes to the ribosome. Translation occurs when tRNA makes a copy of the DNA segment and complementary base pairs are linked to the half of the mRNA strand. The complementary base pairs start to link onto the mRNA strand only when the start codon is identify and complemented. Then the tRNA brings amino acids and builds the amino acids onto the molecule making a protein chain. Finally the base pairs hit the stop codon and translation has completed the new mRNA strand.
-1	Additials information that would be good to now is, why are the students performing this xpirement? Why arent there cups a for measures for distiled water amounts, or vinegar amounts? You should also know why the starting mass for the materials all arent the same.
-1	Plastic type A: stretched from 10to 12 increased 2. Plastic type B: stretched from 22 to 23 increased 1. Plastic C: stretched from 14 to 13 decreased 1. Plastic type D: stayed the same. ^P The student could have improved the experiemental design by performing diffrent trials.
-1	A couple more things I would write in this experiment would be to make a hypothesis. Also when you are putting the rocks to dry make sure all the rocks are in the same place so they all dry evenly. Lastly, I would also I would compare the weights of all the rocks and see which ones heaviest at the begining and the end.
-1	Pandas + koalas are a like, because both are very picky eaters. A panda only eats bamboo where as a koala eats eucalyptus leaves. Both the panda + koala ultimately differ from a python, because a python not only eat different species, but it is also a reptile which a panda + koala are not.
-1	In the article, the author says that koalas and pandas are both specialists. They are different from pythons, because the story says that pythons are generalists.
-1	To repercat this experiment I would need to knew how vingnr, what is the controy and what are the samples.
-1	Pandas in China as well as koalas in Australia, are specialists who have an incredibly slim range of food. They therefore have trouble adapting. Pythons on the other hand, are generalists and can easily adapt to foreign places, as they have in Florida and other places in the U.S.
-1	Panda's in China are like koalas in Australia because there both specialist and they both only eat mostly one thing like for the pandas they mostly eat bamboo and the koalas mostly eat eucalyptus leaves. They are different from a python because python's are generalist and koalas or panda's are specialist.
1	"Based on these results, I can conclude that plastic ""B"" has the most stretchability. These results are valid because of the two trials, so I can confidently conclude this. To improve the validity even more would be to use the same length plastic for each type because this may affect the results. Also, the should give a specific weight to add on the procedure instead of just saying ""add weights""."
1	After reading the groups procedure, several things are needed in order for the experiment to be replicated. First, the four different samples should be identified and the desired mass should be specified. Also the amount of vinegar added to each sample should be identified.
-1	To replicate the experiment, the amount of vinegar put in the container would be needed so it would not vary the results inappropriately. Also, the amount of each sample needs to be added because a greater sample to vinegar ratio will change the mass of the experiment. Also, in the table we can see that the people measured the mass before the samples were put in the vinegar, but without the table we would not know to do it because the procedure did not state if this needs to be added between steps 2 and 3 so later on the difference can be found and the change seen.
1	a) From the information in the data table, I can conclude that plastic Type B stretched the greatest, considering that 22 and23 mm is the highest number compared to the rest. ^p b) Two ways the students could have improved the design are measuring the length of plastic before the trials,and doing one more extra trial to check validity.
-1	I will need to add the vinegar in each of four separate and 24. 24 hours, I remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water and after I determine the mass of each sample.
-1	Based on the student's data, the conclusion can be made because their is nothing to the test the results to. This experiment can be improved by measuring the initial length at the polymer to show the difference in length that the weight did and allow for a conclusion. This can also improve by adding a control to test against their variables to add to the validity.
-1	The procedure could be better  if they included  inthere experiment a control, if they labled each sample specifically with what process they are  using, whether it be, marble, limestone, wood or plastic. Last the procedure doesn't include a clear purpose, why are they doing this experiment ? Is it nessecary, what varaety do they receive from this.
-1	In order to repeat this experiment you would need an electronic balance to measure the mass, cups to put the samples in and water to distill each sample with.
-1	"A specialist is China's panda, which eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's koala bear, which eat eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. ^p Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia by the way they both can eat only one thing. Panda eat bamboo while koalas eats eucalyptus this makes them diffrent from the pythons because pythons need a warm climate and smaller animals to live. ^p Pandas in China are similar to Koalas in Australia because they both don't eat other animals, they're like veggeterians. In the article, it says,  China's panda, which eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's Koala bear, which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively."" They both eat things that are grown from nature."
1	"Based on the students data, plastic type B stretched the most. However, the student could have improved the experimental design and validity of these results. First off, Their should be a required standard length for each type of plastic the directions could be like. ""step 1"" cut a 2omm strip of each plastic"". Also, this experiment should specify the amount of weight placed on the clamp and this exact amount should be repeated throughout the rest of the experiment."
-1	I conclude that plastic type D was able to stretch themost out of all of the plastics. The two things these students would have done to improve ther validity and experimental design is they could have used more trials and they also could have used a control
-1	a) Plastic type A has the highest level of stretchability because from the 1st and the second trial it stretched 2 mm, while the other plastic types only stretched 1 mm or stayed the same. ^p b) Two ways the student could improved the experiment could have been to add more weights to the bags. Another way to improve the validity of the results is to specify how heavy the weights were and how many did he put.
-1	A. In conclusion based on the students data, T1's plastics where a little bit weaker the T2's. ^p (B) One way a student could have im proved the experiment is by adding more length to the plastics. ^p Another way to improve the experiment is by trying more trials.
-1	The two ways the student could have improved experimental design out/or validity of the results are.Procedure:4) Add weights to the clamp and allow them to hang for five minutes.If you do that you doing to know plastics is stronge and can carry a havy thing. 5) Remove the weight and camp and measure the length of the plastic types. After you remove the weights and cound how many weight they can early stuff in the plastic.
-1	"Pandas are similar to koalas because they are both ""specialists"" and not generalists. they are both different than pythons because they are ""generalists"" and do not need an exact food supply like the koala and panda's do."
1	a) In conclusion plastic type B had stretched the most in both trial one and trial two. Plastic type A had stretched the least amount in both trials. ^p b) The students could have added how many weights they put on the plastic, and how much each weight weighed. They should have added how long the plastic was before it was stretched.
-1	What you would need nothing everything seems to be alright with the procedures.
1	It can be concluded that samples B and D had higher stretchability than samples A and C to improve the experiment design, the students could have clarified how many weights they were adding to the clamp because that should have remained constant could for accurate results. Also the student could have made it clear exactly where on the table the samples were being taped because, for example if one was an inch onto the table that would take an inch off the final results.
-1	"Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are both similar because they don't eat any type of meat, unlike pythons were they eat any type of meet like the article says ""A python swallowed an alligator""."
1	My experiment concludes that out of the four plastic polymers, plastic type B was the stretchiest while plastic type A was the least stretchy. My hypothesis on how the plastic would stretch was correct because I know that plastic type B immediately seemed stretched than other plastic types. The students could have improved their experiment by using a constant length for the plastic and using a contrast weight to stretch it with.
-1	I would like to know what the experiment is for ? What are the measurements for all this, how much vinegar in each container ?
1	After the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it goes through the cytoplasm and hooks onto a ribosome. At the ribosome, the tRNA comes and matchs the codons with anti-codons. When the anti-codons have been set on the codons the tRNA then brings over the amino acids that match the codons or anti-codons. They are then held together by a peptide bond.
-1	A conclusion of the student's rest of stretchability on polymers is, plastic type B is the stretchiest because it stretched out the most out off all the other plastics. Plastic type A would be the least stretchiest because it stretched out the least out of all the other plastic types. 2 ways the students could have improved the results are; increase the number of plastics being tested so that you have more results; are increase the number of plastics being tested so that you have more results, The second way is add more weights when stretching out the plastics so you can see how they react under more weight pressure.
-1	A.In the polymer investigation there werent a lot of change plastic type a stretched only 2 mm, type B stretched 1 mm, type c stretched 1mm and D stayed the same.^p B.Could of been more accurate with the steps on the procedure.
-1	A conclusion I can make is that all the plastic types and trials were all about the same thing.^p Hang, the clamps for more than 5 minutes, attach clamp to top edge.
-1	a) My conclusion is that plastic type D was the strongest of them all.^p B) Two way he can improve the experiment is be using the same amount of time, and the same amount of plastics.
1	After reading the group's procedure, there is much additional information that i would need in order to replicate the experiment. First off, you would need to know what the samples are, and what size of samples you will testing. Another piece of information that you would need would be the amount of vinegar that you'd pour in the containers (step two). From steps one and six, you are supposed to determine the mass of all four of the samples that to do this you would need to know what you are taking the mass in. (ie grams, pounds,ouples)
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia they both eat nothing but leaves. They are both different from pythons because in the article it says that a python can reach seven feet in length. Pythons are seen in multiple location in remote regions of the Everglades.
1	A) In conclusion plastic type B was the most stretchable plolymer plastic.^p B) The student could tell you the size of the polymer plastic and make sure all of them are the same size. Also the student can tell you how much weight is being clamped on to the plastic.
-1	"Pandas are the same as Koalas as they are ""mammals"" are warm and fizzy. ""which mean they will have support and more respect. ""Animals such as lizard and snakes tend, tend at least in this culture, to be has respected or supported."
1	You would need to know if the vinegar was to cover the whole sample or not, as this would affect the amount of mass lost. You would need to know how long to rinse the sample in distilled water as it could effect your results and difference in mass. You would also might want to consider how big of a piece of sample to use.
-1	Pandas and koalas differ from pythons by not eating meat,they are not predators,they have arms and   legs and they are friendly.
-1	The conclusion i have drawn is that plastic type D both trials stretched the same amount also that T2 was better. Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and /or validity of the results is by compairing their trials to different plastics and collecting that data.
-1	Well for starters, one is a snake.
-1	The students could have improved their design/results by measuring the weight of the clamp without the weights attached and they could have done a third trial.
-1	you would need an experiment contron, a problem statement and for precision you need more than one trial for each sample
-1	a. Type D plastic stretched the same amount in trial 1 and 2. It stretched 20mm. ^p b. In the procedure the students can get rid of step 7 because step 6 basically states the same thing. Also, they could have done three trials for more data.
-1	Based on the data documented in the table I can conclude that over that plastic type D has the most elasticity because on both trials it stretched to 20mm.Two ways that the student could have improved the design or validity could have been to: specify the amount of the weights being used and specify on what types of plastic to use.This would make the validity higher.
-1	A. Based on the students date, I can conclude that plastic type B is the most flexible at all the samples. ^p B. To improve their experimental design, the students could have added more trials and also specified how much weight to add.
1	A conclusion is that plastic type A is the strongest plastic because once the weight was taken off the plastic didn't stretch that much. ^p ^p A way they could have improved there experiment is that they could have said how heavier the weights were also, they could have made each plastic the same length before adding weights.
1	How long the samples, how much the vinegar, at how big should containers be.
-1	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know the amount of vinegar in each cup, and that the amount remained constant throughout the experiment. You would also need to know how much distilled water was used to rinse the samples.
-1	Write down the results that you come up with, record your data, weigh the samples so  you could determine what the mass is. These are the three things that i would include because in their procedure they never said to weigh the samples so people reading this would think that they would have to guess when it should be weighed. You would also need the total of all the samples.
1	1.How much vinegar & how big a container? (Were the samples completely covered?) ^p 2.What temperature did the samples sit at? ^p 3.Rinse samples how long or until what desired effect ?
-1	They should have told the samples that was used. The second thing was the outcome, what happened to the differ.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia they eat bamboo or Australia's koala bear, which eats eucalyptus. Koalas are different from pythos because they are dangerous. A python swallowed an alligator.
-1	In order to replicate the experiment I need to know what the samples are, such as  wood or marble. I need to know how to find the mass of the samples such as by using a triple beam balance and I need to know how big the samples should be.
-1	Pandas in China are specialists, they only eat bambbo, koala bears in Australia are also specialists because they mainly eat eucalyptus leaves. Pythons on the other hand, are generalists, they can survive in virtually any area that has conditions like their homelands in Asia like the Southern part of America.
-1	Of the four types of plastic A and C stretched about the same amount of weight and D stretched about the same amount. The first way, they could improve the experiment would be to test different amounts of weight. They should also only measure what hangs over the table both times for a more precise result.
1	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know what the samples were. Also, step three in their procedure is a little confusing and to replicate this experiment they may want to give a little bit more directions and be more specific. They might also want to say what size containers to use or how much vinegar to add to the container to allow someone also to replicate.
-1	According to the student's data, the plastic that streched the most was plastic type D and the one that streched the least was plastic type A. ^p I think that this experiment could have been improved by instead of having a second trial, you should have added more time.
1	Through this data recorded from the experiment, we can conclude that plastic A had the strongest polymer setup. This is because it stretched the least throughout both trials. One way  this experiment could have been improved is by creating more contents . For example the weights added to the clamp should have definitly been the same. Also, to improve validity, the student should have had the same starting length of plastics. thing this
-1	3.a. The students experiment was a good experiment because ( they had 4 different plastic types they had two trials to check and recheds for experiment. ^p b. They could have had more trials, they should had more plastic types.
-1	I think the project needs to change
-1	In China a panda is similar to koalas in Australia because one they don't do well around people and two they both only eat onething. Pandas eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves.
-1	This group left out some important details when writing their procedure. In order to replicate this experiment, I would also need to show what I would measure the mass with & how, the amount of vinegar I should put into each container & what the other materials would be. These 3 things would help me to replicate the experiment better.
-1	The additional information I would need in order to replicate this experiment is determining the mass of force different samples, make sure you let  it sit for a white and make sure pour pour vinegar in each of four separate but identical containers.
-1	(A) Based on the students data, I can conclude that plastic types A and B are stretchable; while plastic types C and D made no improvement. ^p (B) A way the experiment and validity could have been improved is by allowing the weights to hang longer. Another way is to try and measure the polymer plastic more than once after being pulled.
-1	Pandas and koalas are similar because the both stick to one source of food and they live in one area. They are different from a python because pythons can live in a bunch of different climates and they eat different foods.
1	I would include what the samples are (wood, marble etc) and would label the containers that way. I would include the brand of vinegar or kind of vinegar used. I would also include at what temperatures the samples were kept at.
-1	"Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both are similar creatures who don't migrate a lot and who have adapted to their environments. For example, ""A specialist is China's panda,which eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's koala bear, which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively"". These are different from pythons because pythons eat many things and go different places. For example,"" the snakes are imperiling 5 endangered species in the Florida Keys...""."
-1	"Place a sample of one material into one container and label, ""repeat with remaining samples"",meaning a sample into a sangle container."
-1	You would need to put the objects needed to sample this experiment. Also you need a hypothesis and a conclusion.
-1	They should take more notes, that way, in case they mess up, they can have a the information how to redo it.
-1	2A)Based on the data, its possible that he's hypothesis was right, because the data seams close to each other, so there's a higher possibility rigth than wrong.  ^p 3) The could have made more trials including a control varable (one that doesn't change ) Another way as by adding more weights but do the procedure a little bat different.
-1	The additional information I would need is how many trials they're going to do. Also how much vinegar they have to por in each container. Another piece of information they should have added is the safety things you need,goggles,gloves etc.
-1	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are both very similar. The article describes how both animals are specialist. The panda eats bamboo and the koala eats eucalyptus. They differ from the python because a python is a generalist. The python is spreading at a rapid unwanted rate by most people.
-1	Some additional information would be make sure the sample is dry to do anything else. Next, make sure you get all the data and make a chart.
-1	Even though pandas live in China and eat almost nothing but bamboo and koalas live in Australia and eat almost nothing but eucalyptus leaves, they both have a major similarity. They are both specialists. A python is also a specialist giving these 3 animals something in common.
1	a, The conclusion is that plastic type D is more stretchable than the most stretchable plastic A. ^p I'd improve this they should have included how much weights was put into each bug and also measurement of the bag before they do the experiment.
-1	Pandas and koala are specialist which means that they eat almost one kind of food. It states this in the article when it says ''almost nothing but almost exclusively'' in paragraph 21 talking about food. Different from pythons because pythons are ''generalist'' more abundant and eat more than one thing and living in different area.
-1	It didn't give enough information.
-1	Some additional information this group would need would be a dependent variable. They would also need to tell how they rinsed the samples. How much vinegar was used. How much of the samples were used. It doesn't say how much was used in step 2 or 3.
-1	The conclusion im gonna draw based on the students data is that there amount of stretched (mm) could go up if they keep investigating. Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and /or validity of the results is that first take a sample of one type of plastic and measure its lenght. And second repeat the procedure exactly for the remaining three plastic samples.
1	a) Plastic B is the stretchiest polymer plastic because of the amount of mm it stretched in the span of five minutes. ^p b) The students needs to make each sample of plastic the exact same size and to improve the validity the could complete a third trial.
1	The additional information that I would need is how much vinegar do you put in the containers, what are the four samples to put something over the containers, and what are steps of the samples.
1	In order to replicate this experiment, the groups would have to list the 4 different mass samples, if not then a person might use any different mass samples. Also the group would have to list the controlled variables such as the size of each weight sample. Lastly to replicate this experiment the group would have to state how much vinegar they are putting into each containers, to make this procedure replicateable, the group would have to make these change.
-1	The way they could had improved the experimental design or the validity results is by adding more to it to make it higher than it is.
-1	Two ways that the stundent could've improved the experiment is by getting a more better brand of plastic or simply redo the experiment.
-1	Well pandas and koalas are similar because they both are endangered spaces boh they are different from pythons because they have less mater elos different living conditions.
-1	From the students data looks like the first trials were good but the second trials the plastic stretches more. It looks like the second trial for A, B, C, O hanged there for a by with the weights the last trial. The student could have improved the experimental design if it would of have more plastics and add ,ore minutes to see what would happen if it stayed longer then 5 minutes. Another way could have been if you knew how many weights you were putting on the clamp. So youwill know how many weights and how long would make this experiment improve.
-1	The Pandas in China are similar to Koalas in Australia because they only eat leaves and bamboo. They are different to the pythons because they don't leave that habit and ie you can't have them as pets on the other hand pythons are wild and a lot of people have them as pets.
-1	The conclusion it draws from this is that they.
-1	"Pandas and koalas are similar, even though they are from different countries. They are both specialists. The panda ""eats almost nothing but bamboo"", and the koala bear ""eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively"". Specialists need to stay in their area to survive. They are both different from pythons because pythons are not specialists; they are generalists, ""who with the assistance of technology can live anywhere"", pandas and koalas can not."
-1	Determine the mass of four different samples.
1	In conclusion, this experiment is not accurate because it did not list the type of plastics that would be used for this experiment. The time was not even recorded. There has got to be evidence & throughout this experiment. For plastic type D, the amount stretched was the same by 20 min. I want to know what type of materials were used. ^p The student could have recorded the time and also show the type of materials that were used throughout the experiment.
-1	I would need to know how much of each material will be needed. Also, I will need to know how large or small the container will have to be for the end results to be identical. Lastly, I must know where the containers were placed, in the sun, shade, etc. or my results may vary.
-1	Pandas in China are the same as koalas in Australia because these two species don't have anywhere else on the earth than these two places. They are both different from pythons because as stated in paragraph 20, they can live in more places than one on the earth than pandas and koalas.
-1	To order to reapit this experiment I need the number of mass, limestone,wood,plastic how much zone I have to doesn't tell us we need to reapit the steped we need  to know how long time we need to do the trials to know if the on same is right.
-1	Based on the students data I can say that plastic type C can stretch the most because in both trials plastic type C stretched atleast 9mm longer than the second hoghest plastic stretchability. To improve the experimental design the students could have said how much weight should be attached to the clamp and exactly what steps should be repeated in the second trial.
-1	After reading the group procedure I would add what the four different samples were for step 3 I would use a example like price marble into one container and label it made so other would be able to make clearly see the steps I took after step ca I would add determine the difference between the ending mass and the starting mass record the difference in mass other information i would are: 1) how to determine the mass and 2)how much vinegar to pour.
-1	Based on the student's data plastic B both trials had the most millimeters for the amount the plastic stretched. Plastic B first trial had 22 mm and the second trial had 23 mm. Also plastic D was the second plastic to have the most millimeters for plastic stretched. At trial one it was at 20mm also for trial two . One way the students could have improved their experiments is by letting us know if were suppose put weights in one at a time or how many. Also, for the second trial the time to allow the plastic to hang could of decrease or increase.
-1	To replicate this experiment and make if beff you will have to have va i in more accurate information, an conclusion and a graph.
-1	a) The type of plastic that stretched the highest amount of mm was plastic type B with a total of 45 mm. The record trial was more than the first trial as shown on the data table. ^p A way that the student could have improved the experimental design could be to stretch the plastic with your hands. A second way would be to wait more than five minutes to take the clarops off.
-1	The panda eat's almost nothing but bamboo or Australia's kala which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively.
1	Plastic type B was the most strechably polymer. The student could have conducted more trails and tell us how much the weights weigh.
-1	One thing you would need to know to complete this experiment is know how much vinegar do you need to put in the vinegar. And lastly how long are you keeping these samples in vinegar for? Days, weeks,it never tells you this information, it would be much more accurate if we knew those following things.
-1	In paragraph 21 it say that China's panda bear eats only bamboo and Australia's koala bear only eats leaves. In paragraph 5 it says that snakes eat meat and that they are canivors. They are besicaly saying the bears are vegiterians & the snake canvores.
-1	What you would need to know to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar to put in each cup. Also you would need to list the materials you were using. Another thing you would need to know is what measurement of the mass would you use.
-1	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know what kind of vinegar you would put the samples in, how much vinegar you would put each sample in and how many times would be needed to rinse each sample of the vinegar.
-1	Plastic type B is the type of plastic you want to put heavy products in because it is more durable than plastic type A which stretches only 12mm, unlike plastic type B which is 23mm. ^p One way the students could have improved the experiment is by giving the amount of how much the weights weighed. Also, give the height of the table top to the floor.
-1	Both pandas and koalas are specialists, and can only live in their habitats and to the fact they can't survive anywhere else. Pythons however, don't require to eating grown food and of effectively almost anywhere.
-1	The additional information that is preferably required is how many drops of vinegar (which may have represented acid rain with a P.H of 3.2:) was put into each sample since: ^p -There were different masses of the given samples eg. marble, 9.8g whereas wood 11.2g. ^p -The ending mass may or may not have decreased in a major difference depending on how much vinegar was instilled. ^p -The mass of the different samples should be the same acquired together with the same amount of vinegar use, just looking for the best sample that could resist acid
1	A) The stretchiest of the four materials was B, with the average stretchincs of 22.5mm's. ^P B) The student could have made sure to cut all the plastic into even strips of the same length and width, and second they could have performed another trial for each plastic.
-1	"The Pandas and the Koalas are similar because they both are specialist. They are different because they're from different parts of the world and they eat different food. They both are different from pythons because pythons eat other animals, example ""A Python swallowed an alligator."" The Pandas and Koalas only eat bamboo and eucalyptus leaves."
1	The measures of every plastic should be the same to start. Secondly, there should be a precise amount of weights being added. My conclusion is that type B stretched the most. It was easily the longest.
-1	Well Im not sure about this answer but if you want the same answer you repeat the steps in order to get the answer. But I think if they do the wood the viniguer will suck up-more because wood suck any liquid up. So it would have a different answer.
1	"I think that the data they have is correct but it shows that plastic type ""A"" is the only one that has a lower trial than the other types. Two ways the students could have improved the experiment was to tell how heavy the weights were and what plastic was used."
-1	Some additional information would be to have a control test with vinegar but stilking with
-1	Specify what the samples are in step 1. Specify how much vinegar in step 2. Specify the size of the container in step 2. In step 4 specify how one should remove the samples from the containers.
1	In order to replicate ta experiment, a person would need to know a few more things. They would need to know which substances to use & how much of each one. The person would need to know how much vinegar to put in the container. They would also need to know what temperature to put ta containers in. One might also want to know what type of container, how to write down the findings.
1	a) Plastic type B has the most strechability because, it streched to 22 and 23mm for both trials. Plastics A, C,and D only reached maximum lengths of 12, 13 or 20mm for both trials. ^P b) The students could have improved their experimental design and/or validity by adding more trials or by ensuring that the same length of plastic hangs on the side of the table.
-1	Koalas and pandas are similar because they are both considered to be specialist species; they can only survive in one specific ecosystem. Those animals are differat from python because pythons are generalist species; pythons can live anywhere in the world.
-1	Panda's only eat bamboo, koala's only eat eucalyptus leaves. Koalas and pandas only eat certain things. Pythons on the other hand pose a major threat which pandas and koalas dnt. Pythons eat key largo wood rats. They have to have tracking devices.
-1	For the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar you would need to pour in each cup. For each sample I would need to no what kind of wood or plastic and how much of each sample should be used.
-1	"Pandas are both similar because on the article it talks about them being ""specialist"" and how they solely survive on one food sources. Panda has bamboo while koalas has eucalyptus. They are both different from pythons because a python is a generalist and can live in different warm environments and as the article said rat, mice, aligator and anything in between."
-1	The additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar they pour into the four seperate containers. They also forgot to say the amount of water they needed to rinse each sample.
-1	1st you need the sample to be the same amount as every other sample, then you need to put same amount of vinegar in all containers and try wasting 1day the 2days to see what would happen.
1	According to the students data, type B polymer plastic stretched the furthest. The students could have improved this experiment by adding more trials and more sure that in step 2 that all the plastic samples were changing freely down the side of the table evenly by measuring the parts taped.
-1	What they missed was the samples that they were pouring, the vinegar on. They need to have every piece of information in the procedure. So other people can do this job.
1	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to use the size of the container the pH of the vinegar and the room temperature
1	In order to replicate this experiment you would need additional information. You would need to know materials,the 4 different samples are,how much vinegar was used,wether or not the material should be completely submerged in the vinegar. Without this information our data could be different.
-1	*They have to do the hypothesis to test if that mass is good to the experiment. ^p *They have to measure the amount of vinegar. ^p *They have to know how much time they have to repeat with remaining samples.
-1	a) One conclusion I observed based on the student's data is that plastic type B is the most stretchable of the 4.^p b) Two ways the experimental design could have been improved are if 1) the student described the amount of weight putting the bags and 2) the student could have done the trials again using more time.
-1	"When the student tested each plastic, ""A"" stretched 2 times more than before. ""B"" only stretched once more, ""C"" went down 1 in the second trial, but ""D"" stayed the same. The way the student could of improved there experiment, would be if they graph each trial for each plastic, so we could see if it increased, decreased, or stayed the same."
-1	It seems that plastic type B is the best. The reason why it was the best was becuse when it stretched it stretched for the longest. Two chuges I would mark would be more trials and more test plastics.
1	It is important to know how much vinegar to put in each container. It is also important to know how long to rinse them with distilled water or how much water should be used. The group should also write in their procedure whether or not they should cover the containers once they have the stone and vinegar in.
-1	Additional information that would be needed to replicate the data would be what equipment is needed for the experiment,what materials are going to be used,and how much of each material will be used?
-1	Pandas in china are similar to koalas in Australia because they both are specialist which means that they favor stability. You can see that both those animals are not use to change because they both stick to the same food source, pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves almost excusively. Panda's an koalas are different from pythons. Pythons are generalist. Generalist favor change unlike pandas are koalas pythons can adapt to various climates.
-1	You would need to have four seperate but identical containers. you would also need to pour in each of them Vinegar to determine the mass of the items being placed in them. And new items would be needed to be placed in each of the containers.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to to Koalas in Australia in which they both eats from nature like leaves and bamboo while python eats other animals like alligator. Also python can live anywher, Pandas and Koala cant. You can have a python as a pet but not Koala's and Pandas.
-1	a) Plastic A was 10mm long & then it reached out to 12mm plastic B was 22mm & then went to 23mm, plastic C was 14mm & then went to 13mm & plastic D was 20mm & than stayed the same. B) One way this student could have improved was to give us the types of plastic besides sayin take one sample of a plastic another way was to give examples & give more details. I say the validity is not right because if I want my store this experiment excatly from word to word then I would have gotten something different.
-1	This procedure is not very specific in its description. For one it does not tell you how to find the mass of the four different samples. It does not indicate the amount of vinegar to put in the container or how much of the sample. It also does not indicate to find the difference in the new mass at the end which is the results that you are really looking for.
-1	A- A conclusion that can be made for this experiment is. In conclusion plastic D would be the strongest type of plastic because according to the data table in both trials plastic D did not stretch. ^p B- Two ways this student could have improved these experiment is by telling us the four different types of plastics used also by telling us how much weight it took to make the plastic stretch and what it is measured in.
1	Based on the students data I conclude that plastic type B stretched the most after five minutes. Plastic type A stretched the least. The students should of told us how many weights to add to the clamp and how much each weight Weighed. They also should of told us what type of plastic they were using.
1	A. Based on the finding the stretchiest plastic is type B, stretching 22mm in T1 and 12mm in T2. The least stretchy would be type A, stretching 10mm in T1 and 12 in T2. ^p B. 1. They needed to specify the size of the plastic samples ( for example 3in*5in). If they weren't all the same size the results would be inaccurate. 2. They also needed to specify the weight without it, one sample could stretch more having 10 pounds on it, than on sample with only 2 porkets on it.
-1	Additional information that we would need in order to replicate the experiment would be to get 4 cups, weigh the 4 cups and then put labels in the four cups with vinegar.
-1	In order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know what the sample of the materials is, you need to control group and you need to what you label to your containers.
1	In this lab a student investigated the stretchability of four different polymer plastics: A, B, C and D. After two trials of each polymer the student concluded that plastic type B had the most stretching strength out of all that were tested. Two ways the student could have improved this experimental design was to make sure the tape that was holding the type of plastic was secure enough to withstand the weight of the clamps and other weights. Another improvement could have been to measure how much of the plastic you tape down.
1	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar they used. Also, you would need to know what size and shape the samples are. Also you would need to know how to dry the samples which it doesn't state.
-1	Plastic A and D were able to withstand the most weights while B and C were the least. The students could have improved by using a control and doing more trials for more accurate test results.
-1	You would need vinegar in each but 4 separate test taab's label them with what they are then wait 4 awer's and see the mass change in the object's you put into the vinegar over night.
-1	The pandas in China are similar to the koalas in Australia because they both have on especific food that they eat. Pandas and koalas are different from pythons because pythons move from place to place adapting to new environment while  the pandas and koalas stay in the same place.
-1	I would need to know how much vinegar was used. I would also need to know what conditions the container was left in when it was left for 24 hours. Lastly, I would need to know more specifics about the sample materials such as what type of wood or plastic was used.
1	a) Based on the student's data, polymer plastic type B was the most stretchable and polymer plastic type A was the most resistance to stretching, or the strongest. Type B stretched an average of 22.5mm, while type A stretched only an average of 11mm, and types C and D came in the middle, stretching averages of 13.5mm, and 20mm. Type A had the strongest polymer in the plastic and type B had the weakest. ^P b.) The first improvement could have been to include control, by testing the stretchability of the materials or plastics without polymers, or running trials on the same plastics without adding weights, to have a valid comparison to see if the polymers are actually what are affecting their stretchability. The second improvement could be to make sure each plastic is of the same thickness, as that can affect stretchability. They could also use more precise instrument or run more trials.
1	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinaggar they poured on the three samples, the size of the samples, and the size of the containers. We would have to know all those things if we wanted to do this lab exactly like they did.
-1	In step 2 of says to pour vinegar in each of four separate but identical containers.
1	At the start of the procedure, we would need to know what four samples we were testing. Otherwise we may test materials not even associated with the experiment. We also need to know how much vinegar we should put in the containers. We finally would also need to know what kind of containers we would put the samples in, plastic, glass? We need to know this as well.
-1	Pandas in China and koalas from Australia are but different from pythons because in paragraph21 it states that pandas eat nothing but bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. But pythons are canivores and says that a python ate an alligator and expaded.
1	Some additional information that you would need in order to replicate this experiment are how much vinegar to put into each container, the size of the material and what kind of container the samples and vinegar are being put into these 3 things would  make very  experiment as close as possible to the group's.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both rely on one plant source as food. In the article it says that pandas eat ''almost nothing but bamboo.'' And koala bears ''eat eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively.'' They are both different from pythons because they aren't being bought to other countries as pets.
-1	"a. The plastic type ""B"" has the most stretchabilty because in both trials it had a large lengths. ^p b) The student could improve the validity of the results by making sure he kept the same time limit. Also he could made none he did not stretch the plastic by hand when releasing the weights."
1	Based on the student's data, I can conclude that plastic B is more flexible. This is because for each trial, it stretched the most. On the other hand, plastic A stretched the least because it only stretched 10mm and 12 mm while B stretched 22mm and 23mm. ^p To improve the validity of the results, the student could have done a third or even fourth trial. This adittional data will make the results clearer. Also, the student should state how much the weights weigh so that others can preform his experiment and get similar results. He might have also wanted to include how long the pieces of plastic were originally.
1	In order to replicate the experiment, we would need to know how much vinegar we add in each sample we testing, 5 lbs, 2 oz etc. Also, we need to know if the containers must be covered or left open. Also, what conditions should they be left in for the 24 hours ? Darkness ? Light ? Both ? This is what we must know to replicate this experiment.
1	The first thing neccassary to replicate this experiment would be the amount of vinegar poured into each contain. The second thing neccasary would be how long we rinse of each sample with D water. The third thing we would have to know would be the volume of the containers.
-1	Pandas and koalas are mostly similar when it comes to the environment they stay in and the fact that they mainly eat one t5hing. Pandas and koalas and different from pythons because unlike pythons, pandas and koalas only eat mainly one thing. Pandas eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves : while a python will try to eat any thing and if it can't handle it, it will explode.
-1	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because thy almost only eat one food. They differ from pythons because pythons eat meat, like alligators, and pandas and koalas eat leaves/ trees.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to Koala bears, because they eat exclusively the Panda with bamboo the Koala with eucalyptus leaves. This is different from pythons because they tend to eat anything. On page 5 it mentions that a python swallowed an alligator whole.
-1	I want to know if the containers are the same size. Also how many times you have to do this experiment until its accurate.
-1	"Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are different from pythons because they at normal and they really dont eat anything. I know this because in the passage, it said, "" China panda eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia koala bear eats eucalyptus leaves. Pandas and koala are similar because they are both specialists."
1	The procedure for the acid rain lab should include several pieces of information that were overlooked. First, there was no specification regarding the samples, the students did not include information as to the general category of materials tested. Let done specify which suitably materials were used: Marble , limestone, wood and plastic. They also failed to determine the temperature the sample were stared at, As well as' the concentration of the vinegar with important  measurements that can pontentially affect data.
1	Additional information to be included into the procedure to replicate it would have to be to clarify in the first step, what the samples are going to be. It would also be good if you were to add where you should put your samples while they are sitting in the vinegar. It would have clarified the procedure also if it were added what we should use to measure the samples. It would also be helpful if the procedure included how much of each sample to test.
-1	Panda's and koalas are similar because they are both specialist but they're different from pythons because pythons are generalist. Which means they can live anywhere unlike specialists.
1	A) From the students results, I see that plastic B was the strongest, stretching 23 mm. Plastic D was next stretching 20 mm. Plastic C was third stretching 14 mm. Lastly plastic A was the weakest stretching 12 mm.^p B) Two ways the students can improve their experiment is to do more trials for better results. Also they could increase the height of the table to avoid the results be tampered, should the plastic stretch to the floor.
1	Based on the student's data, plastic A stretched the least amount. Plastic B stretched the most. Plastic D stretched the same amount of 20 mm during trial 1 and trial 2. To improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment. Another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time. Different weights can cause different results.
-1	"Chinese panda's and Australian koala's are alike because they both eat almost nothing besides one thing. ""Bamboo (panda) or eucalyptus leaves (koala)."" They are different from pythons because pythons prey on more than one source."
-1	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they both eat food from nature, for example pandas eat bamboo, and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves. The difference between the two koala and panda from a python is the different environments they live in . For example, the pythons lives along the canals of Cape Coral, pandas and koalas live near forest
-1	"You would need the amount of vinegar being poured into each of the caps. That because the experiment only tell you to ""pour vinegar"" but when people read if they might not know how much vinegar to put."
-1	They added up around each other, meaning the stretched all almost the same all plastic it was the same both trials. ^p They could put range info on the data table and they could of describe the procedure better.
1	The plastic that stretched the most was B.^ This student could improve by recordin the amount of weight used and having the same amount of weight for each, they could have also added the length of the plastics to show.
-1	China's panda is different from Australia's Koala because panda's eats almost nothing but bamboo and Koala 's eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. They are both different from a python because pythons are a tooth carrnivor's that are found in the canal's of cape coral, who can reach seven feet in length.
-1	a) According to this investigation, the shorter the plastic is the more it will stretch. ^p The experiment is not very valid due to the following: we are not aware of what each plastic type is. Also more trials should have been done so you could have more of a comparison between each trial. Two trials is not enough.
1	A) Based on the data, plastic B was the most strethible plastic. This is because, on average, it stretched 22.5mm in length. The next highest amount stretched, by plastic D, was an average of 20mm in length, showing that plastic B stretched the most. B) One way the student's could've improved their design is by adding a third trial. This could help make sure there was no faulty data, such as an outlier. They also could've written the amount of weight that was stretching the plastics. Otherwise, for all the & prove they could've been changing these weights, which would've given them 2 independent variables, therefore, making their experiment invalid.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to Koalas in Australia because they are native to that area and would have trouble living else where unlike pythons they can't really be spread around the globe. Pythons can go anywhere in the southern U.S. as shown on the map.
-1	This experiment should include an explanation of why students were doing this experiment. They should tell us why the mass decrease and why the wood keep the same mass.
-1	The pand in China eats bamboo and koalas in Australia eats eucalyptus leaves are different than python because the eat plants.
-1	What you would also need to know is why you would leave it in the container for 24 hours, and not any other time .How you got the mass for the four different sample and why you would let it sit out for 30 min.
-1	It  seems that plastic A is the most strechable because it is the only one that stretched longer. Two ways that the students could improve the experiment is to name the different plastics. Also add heavier weights.
-1	Additional information they could have added is mass, the weight of vinegar poured into the samples. They also could have stated what kind of solid samples into categories. 1 more thing that could be changed is have more trials with diffent samples and repeat the process used. Also, they could have waited for more than 30 mins to let the distilled water dry oil out.
-1	what additional information that may be needed in order to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar before the experiment, also the amount of vinegar after taking each sample out of the cup. However, including information about time wouldn't hart the econ't either.
-1	They needed to add what the samples were how the mass should be determined,they need to tell you to table the containers, and you need to record tour data.
1	a) In conclusion, the plastic type that stretched the most was plastic B. ^p b) Two ways that the student could of improved his or her investigation is by saying how many weights will they student put and how much does it weigh . Also, describe how long the plastic  types were before she started her experiment.
1	a. Plastic type B stretched the most with 22-23 mm, and plastic type A stretched the least with 10-12 mm. ^p b. Two ways they could have improved the experimental design is by having all of the plastics being the same length in the beginning and adding a certain amount of weights not just saying ''add weights''.
-1	The student is conclusion is A student performed the following investigation to test four different polymer plastics for stretchability and the two ways the student could is the student not talk procedure polymer and attach a clean to the bottom edge on the plastic sample.
-1	Pandas and koalas are both very specific in what they eat, which is different from pythons whn almost anything.
-1	A and C did not stretch too far, but B and D stretched much more. The student could have given the beginning lengths in his data, or he could have added more and more weights and seen how far the plastics would stretch.
-1	Based on the students data I can conclude plastic type B was the stretchiest polymer. The students could have improved there experimental design by telling us the type of polymer plastics they used, and they should have indicated in the graph how much weight was used on each type of polymer to stretch it out.
-1	A: I think that plastic D in both trials had the most weights out of the three other plastics from the student's data. ^P B: Two ways that the student could have improved the experimental design is one that the student could have done five trials instead of two to see the difference. Also instead of four plastics but five he or she could improve the statement too.
-1	These two type of bears are similar because China panda bears eats bamboo. While the Australias koala bears eat eucalyptus that's how they a similar they both eat plants. Pythons are different because they could live almost anywhere. Also pythons do best in and around humans.
-1	"Panda's in China and koala's in Australia are similar because they are both specialists. Also a panda ""eats nothing but bamboo"" and a koala ""eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively"". They each only eat one plant. They are different from pythons because pythons are generalists and they are not quite as picky; they eat multiple things and other animals."
1	(a) Based on the students data, I can conclude that plastic type A stretched the least. It is the strongest of the four, because it only stretched an average of 11mm (averaged from the two trials), while B's average stretch was 22.5mm C's average stretch was 13.5, and C's average was 20mm. (b). They should have specified the amount of weight. They should have specified the size and shape of the plastic.
-1	You would  have to see what is the amount of rain. Also , need all the measurements  of the vinegar.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they only rely one one food source for panda's it's bamboo and koalas it's eucalyptus leaves, yet they both are different from pythons because they rely on more than one source to survive, and they keep on moving to different locations.
-1	pandas in china and koalas in Australia are similar because they are both specialists, meaning they generally eat the same thing for every meal. Pandas eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves. these animals are different from pythons by not being a generalist meaning that they can survive almost anywhere.
1	Initially, in order to do this expirament one would need to know which individual samples to use and what kind of samples to use. The students should have included the amount of vinegar to pour into each container so the investigation would be consistant in order for the expirament to be accurately reproduced. The students  should have included the type and size of the container, the apparatis used to measure the mass of each sample and included a list of materials for future investigations
-1	Additional information you would need in order to replicate this experiment is a little to show what the students are experimenting. Including writing down the data in the experiment. Make step 3 to separate steps.Also how to find the difference in mass from the starting mass to the ending mass. Another thing to make the experiment better is ti tell how much vinegar to pour into each containers.
-1	After reading the group's procedure, in order to replicate the experiment they would first have to be more specific and tell what the samples had to be. That is the only thing they would need to do.
1	The first, most dmas piece of information missing from the procedure is the 4 types of samples you need in the expirement. You cannot replicate the expirement without knowing what samples to use. The next piece of information missing is how large the sample should be. You should not have to guess what or appropate size should be. Also, the procedure does not include the amount of vinegar needed to be poured into each container. The amount of vinegar needed is essential information. Also, the procedure does not include how or where the samples should be stored. For example, should they be left covered or not?
-1	They could take notes and make a bar graph and put all of it together and come out with the answer. ^p They could use a weight and find out how much the weight by its self.
-1	A hypothesis was needed in this experiment. Also, the group should had told the reader what was happening, why the experiment was taking place. Also they should had repeated the steps at least three times to make sure the results where accurate.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both are not harmful to humans but pythons are pandas and koalas eat the environment pythons eat people of the environment.
1	Based on the student's results, the plastic with the most stretchability is plastic B. Both trials it had the highest length. It beat plastic D by 2 and 3mm. ^p Two ways the student could have improved the experiment is by repeating the experiment at least one more time. It helps the validity of the experiment. Another way he/she could have improved is by having a certain length and shape for the various plastics.
1	1. mRNA leaves the nucleus carry the message from the cell membrane.2. rRNAcarries the ribosome to the codon3. tRNA transfers the segment needed to be traslated.4. the Condon strand is translated.
-1	Pandas in China only eat bamboo leaves and koalas in Australia eat only eucalyptus leaves. These two bears are known as specialists and can only survive in environments that had there speculations. Pythons however, are able to adapt to different environments which allows them to live in more places.
1	a) The most plastic type B had the most stretchability in the trial , it stretched 22mm visible plastic type A stretched 10mm and in trial 2 it stretched 23mm while type A stretched 12mm. ^p b) The students should had the lengths of the plastics start out he same that way no plastic could be able to hold more weights since it was longer. Students should also specify how many weights are added for five minutes so that way a plastic doesn't stretch more just because it had more weights.
1	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know: ^p  1. How much vinegar to put in each container ^p  2. How much water to use when you rinse each sample use distilled water/ temperature of water as well ^p  3. What temperature to put the samples to sit at when drying. ^p  4. How big the containers are ^p  5. What environment is the experiment taking place in? Hot, warm, freezing, wet etc.
1	I say that type B plastic would work the best because it stretches more. One way the students could have made their experiment is could have used specific type of weights. ( We didn't know the weight of them). They could have also repeated the trials.
-1	They could have added all of it up and come up with a average and they could have come up with the mass for all of them.
-1	The additional information that I would need in order to replicate this experiment is where do I leave the containers after I finish putting all the samples into different containers.
1	a. I concluded that plastic type B had the best stretchability and plastic type A had the least.^P b. The student should have included in the procedure how many weight to put on the clamp and describe where on the bottom edge of the plastic to put the clamp.
1	a. Plastic type B stretched the farthest in both trials while plastic type A stretched the least meaning type B was more stretchability than type A. ^p b. One way the student could've improved this experiment would be to add a control group so you could see the initial lengths of the plastics. Another way would be to to add more trials to average out the stretchability.
-1	The students data shows that plastic type B hold the most weight and that plastic type A held the least. I think that the student would have added more trials and recorded the average of the trials. he also should have waited until the plastic bioler to record the data instead of waiting for it to get to a certain length. another thing that could have been done is use less time. The student waited five minute before adding another weight when they could have just added until the plastic ripped.
1	The conclusion for this experiments is the plastic the trials the most stretchable: In trial 1 the amount stretched was 22mm. In trial 2 the amount stretched was 23mm.  ways the students could have improved the experiment design or validity of the results is to include the length before it was stretched and keep the amount of heights constants.
-1	Pandas in China and koala in Australia are similar because they are both specialists. They are both different from pythons because the python is a generalist.
-1	You wouldn't need any information. They provide you with all the information you need. They tell the procedure and they give you the data and they make a chart.
-1	Pandas and koalas are similar because they are both specialist animals. In the article it stated that pandas only eat bamboo, like koalas can only eat eucalyptus leaves. This means that neither would be able to survive in any other place that does not have these plants because they need them to survive. Pythons are different from these creatures because they could survive almost anywhere, surviving off of meat.
-1	The student should list what rock is better and what rock is the worse in the procedure.
1	The additional information that I would need in order to replicate the experiment would be what size do the containers have to be, how much vinegar to pour in the containers, how big do the samples have to be, what should the labels say on them, how much water do I use and how long do I rinse for, and how do I measure the mass ?
-1	Panda's in China and koalas in Australia are similar in that they can only adapt in specific places where their food is. According to the article, pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo and koalas eats eucalyptus leaves, white lizards and reptiles can live in s wide variety of places where their climate is. They can eat a wide variety of food. This sepacates pandas and koalas to be specialist and reptiles to be generalists.
1	Facilitated diffusion- is a way that substances move from one form of concentration to another form of consintration, diffusion- it takes substances from an area of high concentration to low consintraion, osmosis- deals with the water bieng moved
1	a) Plastic type b was the only polymer plastic that was able to stretch out the most while plastic type A was the only polymer plastic that did not stretch out a lot. ^p b) One way that the student could have improved the experimental design would be to state how many weighs to add on the clamp. Another way that it could've been improved was to do more trials.
-1	A conclusion draw is that trail 1 the plastic wasn't that strong to pull but trail 2 it went far and was stretched more. Plastic type D was the same in trail 1 and 2. The students could have improved the experimental design by maybe adding another trial to see what you get. Also they could have use diffrent plastic for the trials.
1	You would need to know the amount of vinegar needed, the type of container and the amount of time to rinse each sample with water.
-1	The additional information you would needs wch one was the best marble, limestone,wood and plastic.
-1	After reading the group procedure the additional information, the info i need is how much vinegar should i pour into the four different cups, how could i prove to make sure its right without more than one trail, what are they really trying to investigate, also what are they actual trying to determine.
-1	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia need to live there. They need to stay there because of their change and food. Im not sure if bamboo or eucalyptus leaves are grown anywhere else. They wouldn't survive anywhere else unlike pythons.
-1	The people doing the lab need to stay in the procedure what matterials to use first. Also, they need to describe how to do all of these steps better so they make more sense. Also, they need to put at the end to repeat the whole thing 3 more times with the other materials instead of putting that in the middle of the procedure.
-1	Pandas are similar to Koalas because they both live off on trees. The panda eats bamboo and the Koalas eats eucalyptus leaves. They are similar because they are both generalists. Pythons are different from pandas and Koalas because a python is a reptile, lives all around the world, and eats meat.
1	Plastic type B stretched the most in both trials one and two. Plastic type A stretched the least in both of the trials.^p The students could have improved the experiment design by conduction more trials and so stating how many weights they added on top of the clamps. The results werent valid.
1	"The group's procedure was pretty vague, there were no numeric values such as how much vinegar, and how large the samples are. Also, each sample should be named in the procedure like ""Determine the mass of marble, limestone, wood and plastic samples"" should be stated in the procedure."
-1	Two ways the student could of improved this experiment is if he would of kept adding weights and masure how low it can go until it breaks. Another way he could of improved this experiment is instead of taping it down a edge tape it down a wall so the force can go straight down. My conclusion based in the students data is the plastic type B is the most stretchable.
1	In order for me to replicate this experiment you would need to know some additional information. One piece of information you need to know is how much vinegar is poured in each container. You also need  to know what the conditions are made out of. The last piece of information you need to know in order to do this experiment is if there is a top on the container.
-1	Well pythons can eat mice and other little animals. You can buy those at the stores. As for the koala and panda they eat certain type of food that can only found in that habitat. So it would be hard to keep them as pet.
1	Additional information needed in order to replicate this experiment would be the amount of vinegar needed to pour into each of the four separate containers. Also the type of containers that that amount of vinegar should be placed into . Also, although indicated in the data table, the students should put into their procedures the types of the four different samples and the starting amount of each and what form they are in. Should it be poured limestone, a block of wood etc. And also they should indicate how much distilled water to rinse the samples with at the end. All of these additional information would be needed in order to replicate the experiment.
1	Based on the data table both trails were basically the same but they could have improve the experiment by using different weights so they could see the difference. Also, the shouldn't have add a clamp to the and of the plastic.
-1	Packet in fat it don't make no sense.
-1	The pandas and the koalas are similar because they are the same specia and due, are different's because pandas eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus.
1	The conclusion that can  be drawn,based on their data, is that that plastic type A was the  least stretchable and is the most durable and plastic type B is the most strechable and the least durable. One way they could've improved their experiment is to have each plastic type have the same amount of length for each piece because that could affect the stretchability of each plastic. Another improvement could be that they could've specified how much plastic should be hanging from the table so each plastic has same amount of length.
-1	Pandas are similar to koalas in Australia because in the article it said panda's eat bamboo & koala eat leaves which shows panda's and koalas aren't hurting us, but they're different than pythons because pythons are dangerous and life thre ate ning to humans, they can destroy homes and anything they basically want to.
-1	You would need what the outcome is after the 24 hours. Label what liquid you used for this lab.
1	Based on the data I can include that plastic B has the most strechability. It had the most streching for both the first and second trial, 22mm and 23 mm. To improve this experiment I would specify how much weight used in each type of plastic and I'd make that a controled variable. I would also include the length of the plastic before it was stretched so I can get a better idea on how stretchable the plastic really is
-1	In order to replicate the experiment I would need the marble, limestone, wood and plastic to be the same starting mass, That way I could tell, which one is mot effective with vinegar, easier.
1	Plastic type A stretched the least out of all 4 plastics, leading to a conclution that it has the worst stretchability of all 4 plastics. Plastic type B stretched the most for both trail test 1 & 2 enough info to conclude that B has the best stretchability. ^p The students could of improved their experiment by adding in the procedure exactly what was the weight of the weights they used and they could of performed a 3rd trail test to see if results were continues and never changing.
-1	"Pandas in China and Koalas in Australia are similar because they only eat one kind of food, "" China's panda eat almost nothing but bamboo, Australia's Koala bears...eat eucalyptus. They are different from pythons because would not take over a land. Also, pandas and Koalas are not deadly like a python that could kill its owners."
-1	Additional information I would need to repeat this experiment includes which four samples we are testing, how much vinegar to pour into the separate containers, how much of the a sample to put into the vinegar, what I would put the samples in after I remove them, and how I would determine the mass of each sample. These things are needed to replicate the experiment exactly or else I would not be able to know the directions and do the experiment the same.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are specialists, which mainly only eat a main plant. A koala and panda ar different from a pytho because it is a generalist and it eats many things.
1	A conclusion on could draw is that plastic type B has the most stretchability. A student could improve the design and results by adding more trials, and specifying how much weight should be added. These two suggestions would durastialy improve the validity of the results as well as improve the design.
-1	a) According to my conclusion B was the one who got stretch the longest and A was the shorter one. b) One way they could do this to make it better is by using different plastics type or by duck taping the plastic to a cup and start putting weighs until it breaks.
1	Conclusively  plastic type B tested to stretch the longest length compared to the other three samples. ^P 1. There is no control in the starting length of the plastics. Different sizes of samples can invalidate the experiments results. ^P 2. The amount of weight attached to the clump should be held constant. Plastic type B, which stretched the longest, could have had more weight on it than the others.
1	There is some additional niformation i would need in order to replicate the experiment, first i would need to know what the four different samples are. Second i would need to know how much vinegar i should pour into the ontainers. Third, i would need to know what type of container i should use. Last, i would need to know where to keep the containers during the 24 hours. These are the things i would need to know to replicate the experiment.
-1	The pandas in China are similar to the koalas in Australia because the both eat plants and also they are peaceful animals. They are different from pythons because pythons cant live up north but pandas and koalas can. Also they are different because pandas and koalas eat plants and pythons eat animals.
-1	So far in the procedure they tell you into determine the mass of samples pour vinegar into each cup. Let silt for 24 hours, take samples sit and dry them. You would then received the ending mass and subtract the difference.
-1	Pandas are similar to koala bears because they both eat a very limited amount of food. Paragraph 21 states that pandas eat almost only bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves. Koalas and pandas bot are different from pythons because koalas and panda eat vegitables, while the python eats small animals like mice.
-1	In order to replicate the group's experiment, you would need to know some additional information to the procedure given. One of these pieces of information is how the group determined the mase of the samples. Was it with a triple balance scale? etc. Another piece of information explained is how long each sample was. Finally, in order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know the amount of vinegar used.
-1	a. Based on the data below it is saying that the plastic could stretch depending on what or how strong the plastic is. B. Explain what is clamp. Have a third trial or have lest durable plastic to do the trials.
-1	Panda's in China are similar to koala in Australia because they both are herbivores. Both pandas an koalas are also in the bear family. They are both different from pythons because pythons eat other animals raw and are carnivors. In paragraph 13 and 14 it explained how a python ate a alligator and in paragraph 21 it shows how pandas and koalas are similar.
-1	"Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia by which they both are ""specialist."" Pandas eats almost nothing but bamboo and koalas eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. Verse pythons are ""generalist"" that could eat anything."
-1	I have concluded that plastic B stretched the most. It stretche about 23mm in all. ^p Name what plastics they were. Measure the plastic before you stretch it.
-1	The first thing thing they did wrong was they didn't explain what their objective and investigation was about. Also they didn't compare any data and talk about the difference in the mass.  They got information, but it did not have any mention to it.
1	To replicate this experiment one would have to know what is meant by the word samples, in other words, samples of what? One would would also have to know what type of container each sample be placed in. Should the samples be placed in a beaker  graduated cylinder or a crucible or any other laboratory container? One would also have to know for how long and how vigorously each sample should be washed after 24 hours.
-1	In order to repeat the students procedure they need to tell how much of each sample is to be placed into each cup. They also should state how long the samples are to be rinsed. If there are different amounts in each cup the experiment will not be valid.
1	Some additional information that I would need would be how much vinegar do I pour into the containers? In what measurement do I measure the four samples.
1	First, you would need to know exactly how much vinegar to pour into each of the identical containers. You would also need to know what the size and material the container is made out of. Lastly, they should tell you where to leave the containers such as in the sun, in a dry, cold place etc.
1	Four major steps involved in protein synthesis are as follows, mRNA enters a ribosome. Then, tRNA delivers amino acids to the ribosome. The mRNA codon matches with the tRNA anti-codon. Also, the amino acids are joined by a condensation reaction. This process is repeated until a stop code is reached.
-1	My conclusion is that plastic type A has the least stretchability and plastic type B has the most stretchability compared to both trials. One way to have improved the experiment design would have been to add weights and let them hang foe ten minutes for the second trial and perform more trials with longer times with weights on the plastic.
-1	1 way this student could have improvert this experiment B by doing more trials so their results done out better. Also they could have hung the weights for a longer period of time.
-1	A)Plastic type B is more flevable and stronger, some plasticstretch more after the first trial like 10mm-12mm^p B) I think having more trials so his data can be more percise and having A catrol
-1	You would have to pour vinegar in each four seperate but identical containers. Let it sit for 24 hours, remove the samples from the container and rinse each sample with distilled water. And then allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes.
-1	a. The data wasn't a clear statement and is inconclusive and they need another trial.^p b.) They could have tested it one more time and if they do they test would be conclusive and be able to draw a conclusion.
-1	It say that panda's and koala bears are the same because both only have 1 food resource. Bamboo(panda) and eucalyptus( koala bear). They're different from snakes because snakes eat what every living thing, like the python that tried to eat an alligator.
1	a. Plastic type B is the most stretchable with an average  of 22.5mm of stretchability. The least most stretchable had an average stretchability of 2.5mm less than type B of 20mm. ^p b) the student could have specified a single starting length for each trial of each type of plastic. ^p The student could have specified the weight to add.
-1	Some additional information i would need is how they found the mass and what type of instrument was being used. Also when they say place a sample of the material, how much of each type am i going to need.
-1	In order to replicate this experiment I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. The group now specified how much vinegar was used in their experiment.
-1	In order to replicate the experiment I would need to know the ammount of vinegar in each container, I would need to know what it is they labelled on the container and I would also need to know the size of each container.
-1	Pandas and koalas are both similar because they only have one source of food. In the article it explains how pandas only eat bamboo and koalas only eat eucalyptus leaves. A python can have multiple food sources and doesn't need one like panda or a koala does.
1	Most plastics stretched 1 to 2 inches longer, one didn't stretch at all and another actually become shorter. I think this data is wrong. When you tape the plastic, tape an inch on the table then add the inch to the final result. They should also put a certain amount of weights.
-1	I conclude that plastics A and C are a little stronger plastics than B and D because the both A and C stretched less than B and D. ^p Maybe 1 way to improve this is maybe wait a little longer until recording restarts because you might get a more interesting result. Another way to improve the validity of the answer to maybe test another time will get a third result making the answers more valid and presentable.
1	Passive Transport-where no energy is needed for the transportation of things in or out of the cell.Active Transport-where energy is required for the transportation of things in or out of the cell.Endocytosis-the process where the cell surrounds sumthing and brings it into the cell because it is to big to travel through one of the channels.
-1	"Pandas in China are very similar to koalas in Australia. Both are specialists meaning that they can only eat & survive in certain climate and region. ""A specialist is China's panda, which eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's koala bear,which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively."" The python however, is the opposite of a specialist and falls under the category of generalist meaning the can adapt to changes."
1	After looking at the data, it showed that plastic type B stretched the most at 22 mm(T1) and 23 mm(T2). Two ways the experiment could have been improved could be to tell us the types of plastics and their starting lengths. Also, to specify the amount of weight thats put or in step four.
-1	(a) In this data it shows how far different type of plastic can be stretched. Plastic type A was stretched 2mm within trial 1 and 2. Plastic type B was stretched 1mm. Lastly plastic type D was stretched 0mm. In conclusion plastic type A was the easiest to stretch. ^p (B) Two ways it could have been improved was a have more tests and what what type of plastic.
-1	Panda's in china and koalas in Australia are similar because they both eat a type of plant. In the article it says china's panda's eats nothing but bamboo, as Australia's koala bear which eats eucalyptus leaves. These two animals are different from pythons because pythons are a danger to human and other animals.
-1	I would need to know what the purpose of me doing the experiment would be and what exactly was I trying to find in order to replicate the experiment.
-1	Plastic Type D stretched the most but on the second trial plastic Type A made the most difference. To improve this project the student could have hung the plastic from a higher surface to see if gravity would stretch it more. Also, the student could have put weights in the middle of the plastic to test if its middle would stretch more and be more durable.
-1	How much do you pour in the containers.
-1	To replicate this experiment you would need to include pieces of additional information. The group of students neglected to specify how much of vinegar that would be poured into each of the containers. When you have put a measurement in your procedures it makes it already more ideal to replicate the experiment.
1	(a) Based on the students data plastic type B stretched the most. All of the bags stretched only around 1 to 2mm difference in both trials compared to their first. ^p (b) Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results was to show the length before they were stretched and show the amount of weight added onto the clamps.
1	Osmosis can be used to diffuse water accross a membrane.An active transport can be used to move objects against the consentration gradient. Protiens imbeded in the membrane are used to do this. It takes more energy than a passive transport.A passive transport uses a consentration gradient to move substances accross the membrane. A passive transport uses little or no energy.
-1	According to the data provided, this experiment had roughly the same outcomes in trial 1 and trial 2. It's either one number higher or lower in trial 2. But, there're two ways that this experiment could be improved. One, explain what type of plastics are being stretched. Two, say how much weight is going to be added to the clamps.
1	Step 1 should be to gather each materials. ^p You need to know what materials to use. ^p Step 7 should tell you how to do the graph.
-1	Pandas almost eats nothing except bamboo and koalas eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. Pythons could snack their way right up the polomac . Also looking at the reptile habitat map makes it obvious that pythons eat more than one thing.
-1	I need the viger the area and the weight to know the mass.
1	Based on the student's data, plastic B stretched more. b The students could have improved the experiment by resting the plastics at the same length  also by doing more than just two trials using sam. Putting same amount of weight in the type of plastic bag.
-1	a.Based on the data from the experiment the plastics that bell's the most was plastic B in the first trial it expanded 22 min 23 min in the second trial.B. This experiment is belong a control and needs more trials to improve the validity.
-1	"Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialist, and they both eat plants. According to MacInnes ""The ultimate generalist is a human , who can live anywhere from Florida to America."" In other words a generalist can live in warm and cold weather, where as a specialist cannot."
-1	For one the student could of use two wheights instead of one. And also use a diferent method for example instead of hanging the bowls from the table hang them up from a high place.
-1	Specialist are Pandas and Koalas that only eat certain things unlike humans. Bomers or Pythons who are generalists and can survive almost anywhere because we're not paky eaters.
-1	The additional information needed is the amount of vinegar in each sample, the amount of sample poured in each containers, and in the end of the experiment the procedure does not tell you to weigh the ending sample, without this information you cannot fulfill this lab to get the data recorded in the table.
-1	a) Plastic type B is the the most elastic plastic and type A is the least elastic plastic, however, all plastic types are elastic. ^p b) The student could have included a specific weight to use and they could have provided elastic types.
-1	Pandas in China and koala's in Australia are similar because they both eat leaves and bamboo and would only survive in the jungle. In the article it says that pandas eat ''almost nothing but bamboo,'' and Australia's koala bear ''eats eucalyptus leaves.'' They differ from pythons because they're able to live anywhere.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists. Both eat almost nothing but a certain type of plant from their native lands. Both koalas and pandas are different from pythons in that, according to the author, pythons are generalists. They are able to live in many places though small adaptations such as eating whatever animals they can find.
-1	In this experiment you would need the amount of vinegar that you would pour into the containers. You would also have to have a specific amount that you would use to sample each material. This would allow one compare each sample effectively. In step 4, The procedure says to remove the sample. In order to replicate the experiment one would need more information on how to remove the sample from the containers.
1	One conclusion you can draw is that plastic sample B has the best stretchability. ^p The students could have made this better /or more valid by having a third trial as well. And state how much weight is being added to the plastic.
-1	You would need to add the type of solution the stones on goingin.
-1	What you need is more trials, a control set up, and an exact amount of vinegar to pour in each cup/beaker. You could also take and check the mass every 30 min or 1 hour.
-1	Pandas in China and Koalas in Australia are both example of specialists with very specific diets as shown in the article. The pythons on the other hand are generalists who can adapt and spread fairly easily in a wide range of places.
-1	Pandas and Koalas are both mammals and they're not carnivores unlike a snake. Pandas eat bamboo and Koalas eat eucalyptus leaves. Snakes eat mice, birds, and other animals for an example, in the article it said a python ate a alligator. A python is also a reptile not a mammal.
1	The three ways cells move things across their membraine is osmosis, active transport and passive transport. Osmosis is the diffusion of water accross a semi-permiable membrane and doesnt require any energy. Active transport is when molecules are getting diffused against the concentration gradient and passive transport is when molecules are diffused going with the concentration garadient
1	a) Based on the results, plastie type A was the least flexible, while plastic type B was the most flexible. ^p b) 1) The student doesn't say where on the table to tape the tap edge of the sample. 2: The student uses samples with varying length, therefore making his results invalid.
-1	They should include in their procedure what the four samples of material they were using, their predictions for what would occur with those four objects and it should tell the reader to find the difference between the new and old mass to find out if the idem was affected.
1	Plastic type B has the most stretchability. One way that this could have improved is if the students did another trial to make sure that their experiment was valid. Another thing the students want to do is make sure they have the same size of plastic to start with.
1	Osmosis is when water is passing through the cell. Active transport is when the cell requires energy to move a substance throgh a membrane. Passive transport is whe a substance does not require the use of energy to be moved out of the cell.
1	A.) Plastic type B is the stretchiest of all the plastics tested. Plastic A is the strongest and stretche the least amount. ^p B.) The student should have andesire that the plastic sheets started out the same length. Also must have had the same amount of weights applied.
-1	What was the mass after 30 minutes. ^p What was the mass after 24 hours. ^p What was the influence between each time.
-1	To replicate the experiment you are need to divide the different substances add more vinegar to each containers add more distilled water having them sit for 24 hours for about 30 minutes mass them and see how they wash.
-1	I would need ^p wood mass=starting 11.2 ending11.2 ^p marble mass=starting 9.8 ending 9.4 ^p plastic mass=starting 7.2 ending 7.1
1	Active Transport-This is the transport of something when energy is neededPassive Transport-This is the transport of something without using energyDiffusion-This is the natural movement of a higher concntration to a lower concentration.
-1	The additional information I would need to know in order to replicate the experiment is what kind of samples they are using. In step 1, it tells me to determine the mass of four different samples, but doesn't tell me which kind. In step 2, It tells me to pour vinegar into each container but doesn't tell me what size or type of container. After sample are removed from the containers after 24 hours, I need to find the mass of each sample. Step 6, but they don;t tell me to subtract the end mass from the slurhnf.
-1	I don't know what is going on!
1	Based on the data, we can tell that plastic type A stretches the least amount of all other types of plastic. It only stretched an average of 11 mm which was less than all others. The students could improve their experiment by adding another trial. This always verifies the validity of an experiment. They could also verify how long the strip of plastic is and keep that constant throughout the experiment.
1	So additional information you would add in order to replicate the experiment would be what kind of containers
-1	polymer A is a more hard and less maliable plastic which would been it would be like a 1 on 3 plastic D is really maliable and stretch so it would be a politer polymer. They could improve on the design. By may be using, more weight so they get more stretch and see its limits and way it  stretches because so polymers stretch in different directions. They would do one more trial to get more data and make it more valid.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both eat just about the same way. Well the panda eats almost nothing but bamboo and the koala eats eucalyptus says in paragraph 21. However, they're both different because they both come from two different parts of the earth.
-1	"China pandas are similar to Australian koalas because both species are specialists. A specialist eats only whats in the enviroment, it cannot change enviroments. These two species are different from pythons because the python is a generalist. Joel relates, ""a generalist with the assistance of technology can live anywhere""."
-1	Pandas in China are similar to Koala in Australia because they have adapted to the reigion they live in and only eat leaves or the bamboo. They're both different from pythons because they haven't over populated and don't attach every thing that is edible.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because the article states that ''China'' pandas which eats almost nothing but bamboo and koala bears which eats eucalyptus leaves exclusively. Therefor they only eat the vegetation things while pythons are meat eater for example a python swallowed the alligator.
-1	What I would add in the procedure is that  I what are the materials you need, 2 record your data, 3 what is your conclusion what did you come up with.
1	To replicate this procedure you would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container. It would also be useful to know if the temperature of the room should be. Lastly, they should tell you what size of each sample you should be taking. If they do not add in these things the experiment may have a different result when done by someone else.
1	The three information missed in that lab is the measure of vinegar, size of the container and also the size of each sample because if one of those are diffrent it's easily affected the final result.
-1	Based on the data, I can conclude that plastic A+B stretched more than C+D. The student could have improved the validity of this experiment by conducting more trials. With more trials it is easier to take a more accurate average. Next, the could also say the type of plastic. Instead of saying A, B, C, D their experiment would be better developed. Easier for the reader to follow. This is what can be concluded from the data, along with what could be improved throughout the experiment.
1	According to the student's data plastic types B seems to be the most stretchable and plastic type A seems to be the most durable. I think they should have done a third trial and specified a certain weight amount.
1	a. Based on the students data the conclusion I draw was that plastic B had the greatest stretchability. ^p b. One way that this student could have improved this experiment is to add more trials to have more data to trials conclusions with Another way the student could have improved the experiment was.
1	The additional information you would need in order to replicate the expierence is the 4 samples. The starting mass the ending mass and the time. Also the difference in mass.
1	In order to replicate this experiment, the group would need some additional information in their procedure. An example would be how this group determined the mass of the substance. They need specifics like how much vinegar they need in each container, or how big the sample is or what the sample is. It's very vague, so they should add more specific.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they're both specialist animals meaning they eat almost one thing. For example, pandas eat bamboo and koalas only eat eucalyptus leaves. They are different from pythons because pythons are generalist species and can survive well almost anywhere.
-1	Pandas in China An koalas in Australia are similar to one another because they are both considered specialist species.  A panda eats nothing but bamboo and a koala eats nothing but eucalyptus leaves. A python differs from these animals because it is a generalist and can adapt anywhere.
-1	I would need the procedure, the samples, starting mass, ending mass and difference in mass.
-1	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are not like pythons at all. Pandas only eat bamboo and koalas only eat eucalyptus leaves. In the Everglades in 2005 a python swallowed an alligator and exploded. This shows that pythons will try to eat anything if their habitat is changed.
1	Plastic B was the most stretchable .It stretched 22 mm that and 23mm that 12 plastic A was the least stretchable.It only stretched 10mm in Trial 1 and 12mm in trial 2.Plastic D was the 2nd stretchiest with 20mm in the first trial and 20mm in the 2nd trial. And  plastic C was the 3rd stretchest with 14mm in the 1st and 2nd 13mm in the 2nd trial to improve the experiment they could have used the same length of plastic preceding the stretching.
1	1. What kind of samples ? ^p 2. How much vinegar ? ^p 3. What kind of container ?
1	a) Plastic type B stretched the most, and plastic type A stretched the least. ^p b) Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design are to specify the starting length of the plastic samples, and to specify the amount of weight added to each clamp.
-1	The information I would need in order to sucessfully replicate the experiment is the correct measurement they used for the experiment, also the materials that was used to creat the experiament. After the 24 hours, of removing the samples from the container and rinsen each sample with distilled water. Making it dry for 30 mintued might not be long enough to really determine the mass of each sample, especially when you have more than one different samples to do with different texture.
-1	The iddtional information that I would need in order to replicate the experiment are the following:what changes had each sample after sitting 24hrs. And the 2 one would be what was the exact amount of vinegar,we pour in each four separete but equal containers how did and last what was the outcome of this investigation. What did we learn
-1	NSR
1	How much vinegar do you use for each cup of samples. They should have said how much water to rinse each sample with; Also could you try different liquids.
-1	The information you need in order to replicate this experiment is how much of each sample you are putting into the containers. Maybe you should also state what the containers you are using look like.
-1	In conclusion two ways the students could have improved the experiment design is to add a weight to the clamp and let them hang for more time. Also another way the student could have improved the design is to add the same weights to the plastic.
-1	From the data, it's drawn that type B has the most stretchability than the others. In trial one, it held the highest weight count for 20 weights. In the second trial it had a total of 23. For the experiment to give a more accurate result, the weights should have been added on past the limit for each plastic. That way data could show how many weights each held until breaking, strengthening the results for or against the hypothesis.
-1	In order to replicate the experiment the student need to write in detail a hypothesis for the experiment list the materials and samples needed and write out a conclusien to what those results to the experiment are
1	If I were to replicate this experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar to pour, what temperature to keep the experiment anothe vinegar, and what temperature to keep the experiment drying.
-1	(A)It appears that sample A was the strongest. After trial 1 it was 10mm and after trial 2 it was 12mm. Samples B and D were the weakest, sample B after trial 1 was 22mm and sample D was 20mm and after trial 2 sample B was 23mm and sample was 20mm.^p (B)One way the student could have improved the experiment is by specifically saying what plastic he was testing . Another way is by saying how much the weights weighed.
-1	"In conclusion, plastic type B was the strongest out of all the plastic types. It stretched the most. Plastic type A was the weakest. ^p These students could have improved their experiement by writing ""record your data"" in the procedure after each trial. Also they could have created a graph to show their results in a clearer way."
-1	I conclude that plastic type D didn't stretch all all because the (mm) length hasn't changed. One way they could have improved the experiment is by telling us kind of plastic they used. Another way is that they could have told us how heavy the weights were that they were using.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to Koalas in Australia because pandas eat bamboo because they are surrounded by it and Koala's eat eucalyptus leaves because they are surrounded by those.These 2 animals are both different than a python because pythons are more harmful and unlike pandas and Koalas will eat anything. In the article it says a phython are an alligator exploded.
1	Additional information needed to replicate the experiment would be how much vinegar was added to each of the four separate containers. Also you might say how long to rinse the samples under distilled water for. Finally, the students should also state where to place each cup during the experiment and to dry. You need to know whether it should be in a cold, wet environment or maybe warm & dry.
-1	After reading the group's procedure, you would need to know the problem in order to formulate a hypothesis, the materials so that you could directly replicate the procedure and the validity of the experiment so that you could repeat the experiment and conduct further trials in order to perhaps acheive more accurate results.
1	(a) Based on the experiments, plastic type A is the strongest of all plastics, plastic B is the weakest. B is the weakest because it stretched the most and this could be because the plastic is thin, while plastic A was more thick: instead of a linear polymer like B, plastic A was probably a tratched polymer with many different bonds. ^P (b) To improve the expirement, the students should have use the same amount of each plastic to test. The size of the plastic adds another variable to the expirement. They should also specify which weights they use and should make the weight for each plastic constant.
1	What are the four different samples? There is no control so how do you know what water is. How much vinegar do you need to put into the containers, how big does the sample need to be.
-1	The limestone have mass than all of them.
-1	China's panda eat nothing but simple bamboo as Australia's koalas bears eats eucalyptus leaves. They both eat a certain thing and stick to it. Unlike the python it will eat anything in it's area an example could be the crocodile. They get along best with humans than pythons.
-1	The conclusion based on the student data is that plastic type D is the least stretchable and type A is the most stretchable. ^p To improve the experiment the students should have add more trials and also tested different amounts of weights so they could see how each plastic type reached when even more weight was put on.
-1	The procedure has to be more specific. It should include that the experiment needs an ending mass and the difference of the beginning and end. It should have materials listed. It should have within the procedure a mini procedure for each material.
1	Next, mRNA attaches to a ribosome where the code on it will be translated to the order of amino acids needed to make a protein.  rRNA combines with the ribosome to help chain the amino acids to form a polypeptide chain.  tRNA finds amino acids that match with the code it carries and takes carries them to the ribosome where it matches its amino acids to the code on teh mRNA.  All of the the amino acids at the ribosome form a polypeptide which is then formed into a protein.
-1	You may want to tell in the experiment how much vinegar you are pouring in; Explain how you found the differences in mass, mass before you rinse with the distilled water.
1	For this experiment, you would actually need to know what each ''sample'' is, the amount of vinegar that was used and the size of each ''sample''
-1	Pandas in china eat bamboo almost exclusively while koalas eat only eucalyptus.They are both considered specialists who need to eat limited foods or live in a unique environment. Pythons on the other hand can live in a wide range of places like a third of the US alone.
-1	According to the article, Panda's and koala's have a very simple diet. In paragraph 21, the author explains that pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo and koala bears only eat eucalyptus leaves. They are different from the python because pythons eat an assessment of different animals. Paragraph 14 said it ate an alligator.
-1	Pandas and koalas are similar because they both eat plant's and only one type of plant pandas eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves. Both of these animals different from pythons because pythons are invasive species.
-1	Panda's and koalas are both similar because they are specialist. They need a very specific climate to live or they will die. Pythons differ from these two animals because pythons are generalist. Pythons have a much broader range that they can survive in.
1	To replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to use, how big of a sample to use and how long to rinse each sample. Without these you cannot replicate the experiment.
-1	The pandas in China are similar to the koala in Australia because they are both specialists, and they require one type of food that is the only thing they eat. They are different from pythons because a python could survive in one third of the United State's climate among othe4r places while at the same time pandas and koalas can't.
-1	The pieces they forgot to include were, how much vinegar did they use to test each sample and also how much was each sample used in this investigation. Also they forgot to write how long you need to leave the vinegar in the containers was in the substances.
1	One thing you would need to know is what use of containers  you need. In step 2 they do not say the size of the container, they just said you need them. Also in step one it just says to determine the mass of four different samples that is very unclear because it does not tell you what samples to measure. Als in step two it does not tell you the amount of vinager to pour into the containers.
-1	You will need more mass and you have to dry it for 30 minutes. After 24 hours, remove the samples from the containers and note each sample with distilled water. You will probably need more of a little bit of everything.
-1	First off, I'd need to know maybe the material of each sample
-1	Two ways the students could have improved the experiment design is to added different weights to see how much long the plastic could stretch until it trips. Another is to do more than two trial to make more reliable.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both stick to one primary food. Unlike pythons, which can eat anything and everywhere. Also, pythons adapt better to different climates/surroundings.
-1	It says that China's panda and Australia's koala are specialists. This means that they can only eat and be in  certain places. In the article it says that china's panda eats almost nothing but bamboo and Australia's koala eats eucalyptus leaves. Unlike the python who is a generalist which can be compared to a human and live just about anywhere.
1	One of the ways cells can move substances across the cell membrane is by diffusion. Diffusion moves substances from an area of high concentration, to an area of low concentration. Another way cells move substances across the cell membrane is by osmosis. Osmosis moves water down the cell membrane. The last way cells move substances across the cell membrane is by the sodium-potassium pump. The sodium-potassium pump takes sodium ions out of the membrane and puts potassium ions into the membrane.
1	In order to run this experiment I would need to know what samples are being tested. I would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each solution. I would also need to know what size the container should be that I'm pouring the solutions into.
-1	In order to create do able experiment you would need to add a material list describing the items needed and how much of each. Also independent and dependent variables and a hypothesis to back up your research.
-1	Panda's in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both eat plants and they both live in the wildlife. They are both different from because have claus, they're bigger, and eat different meals. A python can swallow an alligator, and pandas and koalas cannot.
-1	China's Panda eats almost nothing but bamboo, and Australia's Koala bear eats mostly eucalyptus leaves. Because of their stability, they are both classified as specialist. The article states that a python can live in changed envirements and adapt to them, unlike the Panda and Koala bear.
-1	First the stat mass should of been the same. It's know a product that they did nothing to they did change, anything you can change the time.
-1	Panda's and koalas are similar because they eat one thing only like the panda eats bamboo and the koala eat eucalyptus leaves and the different from a python because pythons eat everything.
1	In this experiment, many things were not mentioned in the procedure that was crucial in order to replicate it, first was that the names of the sample were not given, so we don't know what to take the mass of. Second was that it didn't tell how much vinegar to pour into the container in the beginng of the procedure. Lastly, we would need to know where to put the sample containers for the 24-hour time period. Other than this, the experiment was written decently.
1	a) The conclusion has been drawn that plastic type B stretches the most.^p b) Two ways to improve this experiment would be be tell how long to cut each plastic and how heavy the weights should be.
-1	You would need to know how much vinegar was used in each container and how much of a sample to test in the experiment. Also if the mass of each sample is different, for example marble being 9.8 grams, plastic being 7.2 grams and wood being 11.2 grams, how is the mass of each determined?
1	"According to their, the students results, plastic sample A is the least stretchy while sample B was the most stretchy. I do not, however, believe these results are valid. They should have used exact measurement when saying to ""add weight"" to the clamp. Another thing they could have done was added a third trial for increased accuracy, and to that same note come up with an average stretch distance for each sample, making it even more accurate."
1	In the procedure, it would be best if they said the amount of vinegar to pour onto the samples and which samples do you use in the sample. Finally, additional information that should be added would be, telling where to keep these samples, where it's cold, room or hot temperature.
1	"The first thing I would add to the experiment is that the vinegar should be measured the same amount for all 4. Also, the procedure should saw what the ""4 different samples"" are ( marble, limestone, wood,plastic). Also, after placing the samples into containers, I believe the containers should be placed in the same location temperature as the others."
1	The additional infomation you would need to replicate the experiment would include the size of the samples. Also you would need to know the kind of vinegar. In a ddition it is crucial to get the same type and size containers.
-1	A=is not much of diference of T1 to T2 is only 1 or 2 mm so is really acuret. B= they shouded have more plastic type and more trials.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both plant eaters and are becoming extinct. They both differ to the python because the python is spreading rapidly. As stated in the article, ''many invasive species under go a lag before proliferating.'' which means that they are spreading rapidly.
-1	To replicate this experiment you will need the following vingar, to your in each identical container, you will need to let the sample sit and dry for30 minutes. After 24 hour remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water.
-1	In the conclusion, the plastic strech out longest in T2 the T1. ^P The way they could of make there expriment better is by ading more weght every jeswon with the same timty.
-1	If you want to replicate the experiment you would need to get a new starting mass, ending mass and a difference in mass. You will also need to find new rocks to experient to find different mass of each rock. You will also need new vinegar so they dont get mixed up with the other vinegar.
-1	I
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both are considered a specialist species, meaning they are only found in one area and eat rarely anything else but one thing. They are different from the python because it is a generalist species, one that can be found in a variety of places and eats many different things.
-1	To duplicate this experiment you would also need to know the brands of all the products on its accurate, the environment the experiment was in and what kind of scale was used so that the replicate experiment is  identical making it move accurate.
-1	To replicate this experiment, I need to know the exact volume of the vinegar at the begining, and the volume at the end of the experiment.
-1	1. Determine the mass of four different samples. ^p 2. Instead of pouring vinegar, pour a different kind of liquid. ^p 3. Use three different kind of containers to see what happens. ^p 4. After 24 hours, remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water. ^p 5. Allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 min. ^p 6. Determine the mass of each sample.
-1	In these procedure it's not explained what this sample is that there putting in. So if we knew exactly what is was it would help. There should be a control with containers without vinegar to compare to the other samples with vinegar. The last thing to make the procedure right is to know the mass of each sample to know much to use.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to Koalas on Australia because they are both specialists and they mainly eat one type of food . They are both different  because they eat different things, also they both live in different places of the world.
-1	The conclusion that B is the strechiest and A is the least. Two way's the student could have made his experiment better was test the dip is the plastics and the width.
1	a) Plastic B stretches the most. ^p b) The student should have kept the length and width of the plastic samples constant and specified how much weight to attatch.
1	a.) Based on the data, it can be concluded that plastic types B has the least streghth or the most elasticity because it stretched the farthest of all the other plastics. Plastic D is the second and plastic C is the third plastic with least streghth or most elasticity. Since plastic A had the least stretched legnth, it is the strongest or least plastic plastic. ^p b.) To improve the validity of this experiment, it would be wise to msure that each plastic is not only the same size, but is also taped at the exact same spot to the table, and is clamped at the same spot as well. This will allow for the removal of other ine-wencing factors. It is also important to specify the amount of weight that is used. The same amount of weight should be used for each plastic trial to ensure that weight is not a variable in the experiment.
-1	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar in that they are specialist species. As it says in the article pandas eat almost exclusively bamboo and live only in china and koalas eat almost exclusively eucalyptus leaves and live only in Australia. These are both different from pythons generalist species because pythons eat from different foods and can live in many different places or climate with a certain range of conditions.
-1	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they both need warmth and they both eat plants. These two animals are much more different than snakes because snakes eat mice, rats, and the python will eat a key largo wood rat cracked down in the belly.
-1	Pandas from China are similar to koalas in Australia because both animals basically eat one thing. A panda eats bamboo and a koala mostly eats eucalyptus leaves. Both animals only eat plant. But a python does not. A python has to eat other organisms based on its size. A panda and koalas are similar but a python has many differences.
1	Based on the data collected from the experiment you can conclude that plastic type D stretched the most. Validity: The students did two trials and their results from the second tool were very similar to the first trial. One way the student could of improved the experiment is adding more weight to see if they could of stretched further. Another way to improve the experiment is by using more then one type of plastic.
-1	I would say that plastic type B is the most  stretchable type of plastic because in test 1 and 2 it doubled plastic types A and C.
1	In order to replicate the groups procedure I would need to know how much vinegar was poured into the containers, how large the containers were and how thoroughly the containers should be rinsed. With these pieces of information I could more accuratly follow the procedure and hopefully get similar results.
-1	Pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo and koala bear which eats eucalyptus leaves they are similar because they both just eat plants. They both are different from pythons because a python is a reptile and a snake and eats mice and other kinds of animals and you really don't see pandas and koala bears in the street and other weird places.
-1	This experiment is not right because they would need to tell how much vinegar they put in each cup and it will have to all be the same.
1	After reading this procedure, other additional information you would need to replicate the experiment is in the procedure they should state the materials that there going to be testing instead of saying samples. Another is they should have more controlled valiable instead of other samples tosit for 30 min they should have more to determine what to do with samples and containers. They should have a control to test the results and see how this varied against the control. This is the same information I would need to replicate the experiment.
-1	In the article it says that both koalas and pandas are specialist species. While pythons are generalist species so pandas and koalas are similar because they eat specific types of food, while pythons will eat almost anything.
-1	In order to replicate this procedure, it would have to tell what the samples are. There is no way of correctly replicating if the wrong samples are used, which could happen without proper explanation.
-1	Some additional information you would need is what samples there putting in. They need a a hypothesis showing what conclusion for the hypothesis.
-1	Additional information needed is you would need to know is, what the mass from the camse containers when they were full. You need to know the four different samples. How many containers you need.
-1	What is the independent variable and what the devendent variable also don't ^p forget about the control.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both tent to eat only one thing. This panda eats bamboo and the koala eats eucalyptus leaves. The python on one other hand will eat everything that fills them up.
-1	I guess when the plastic reaches a certain amount it will break. ^p They should of used a different type of plastic to see how it works out.
-1	You have to minus the ending mass from the starting mass.
-1	You would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container and also what was the starting mass and the ending time for the experiment.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both need specific foods and substances to survive. I know this because the author says ''a specialist is China's panda wich eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's koala bear, wich eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively.'' Unlike a panda and koala pythons have more options for food ''you could conceivably have pythons snalking their way up the Potomac obviasly  they differ a lot from pandas and koala
-1	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to
1	To replicate this I would need much more information as to sizes of samples. Also, there should be more specific size measurements of the containar. Lastly, they never say how much vinegar to use. ^p All of these are important to being able to replicate the experiment.
1	Based on the student's investigation, I conclude that plastic types B and D are weaker polymers than plastic types A and C. Both B and D stretched much farther than A and C, which indicates that their polymer chains are not as strong. This student could improve the experimental design by using the same length of each sample to ensure that it is not a variable. Also, the student cold have used a set number of weight to make sure each sample was stretched by exactly the same forces.
-1	Chinas panda and Australias koala bear are specialist which means they may not adapt to living in another environment that's not like theirs, unlike generalist they adapt quicker because they are from the wildlife. You dont see a Chinese panda, and an Australian koala bear in any type of environment you can just tell by the food they eat.
-1	a)According to the data shown, plastic type D has the most stretchability.^p (b)The student could have done more trials, made a line graph, and tested the plastics for different times.
-1	Plastic type A stretches longer than the other plastic types. The student could improve the experiment by putting the name of plastics. And add another trial. 3 trials are always best.
-1	If you want to replicate the experiment you will need more containers exactly alike, marble, limestone, wood and plastic, also fresh cups of viniger.
-1	The pandas in China eat nothing but bamboo and Australia's koala bear eat eucalyptus leaves almost every day. Mammals like a panda and a koala bear, are warm and fuzzy, while animals such as snakes and pythons, are less well respected or supported, which koala bears and pandas are different from pythons.
-1	First off these groups of students forgot to addd in step 2 how much vinegar in going to be poured in each identical container. In step number 5 the students did not say to organize the samples so you can record it as separate data because each sample is different (marble, limestone, wood, plastic). The students also forgot to include step 7, which is find the differences in mass. If another group of students were going to do this exact experiment they wouldn't know what they are comparing.
-1	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know how to find the mass of the samples, possibly using an electronic  balance. I would also need to know how big of a container to use. Sometimes, if you have a lot of vinegar, the results will be different. I would also need to know the purpose of the lab. Is it to see the effects vinegar has on each of the sambles?
1	In protein synthesis, after the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it carries the instructions to the cytooplasm.  It then enters a ribosome and prepares to be copied.  Transfer RNA brings the codons attached to the amino acid to the ribosome. It attaches at the first bonding site which  matches the complementary codons. THe tRNA the moves on the the next bonding site where it releases the amino acid which attaches to the amino acid on the tRNA behind it.  Once the mRNA reaches a stop codon, the amino acids detach and form a polypeptide bond.
1	1) The student can conclude that plastic B stretches the most. According to the data plastic B stretched the most both trials. Twenty two mm in the first and twenty three in the second. While the other plastics stretched less.^p 2) The student should perform a third trial for accuracy and the student should keep a constant number of weights attached to each plastic.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas because they can survive in the same climate. But are different from pythons because pythons can survive in any climate for example in the story were food spread all over the U.S.
-1	Some additional information that I would need is the amount of vinegar they poured.
1	I can conclude that plastic type B is the stretchiest because it stretched to 22 and 23mm. ^p The student could specify the amount of plastic that was hanging over the edge. The student could also say how much weight he was using.
-1	Some additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar was poured into the separate containers, what kinda of containers or size of container. Was each sample poured in to. And finally why did the group of students ande with distilled water. Why couldn't they just leave it how it was.
-1	Pandas and koalas are different pythons because they eat only one certain thing each and pythons will eat mostly anything. Pandas eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus.
-1	A panda and a koala are both different from a python because the panda and koala are in the category of a specialist. The python is a generalist which are more favored by humans.
-1	There is one piece of information on that you would need in order to replicate this experiment that they forgot. You need to know the amount of vinegar that needs to go into each cup. If you didnt know that the whole experiment wouldnt be correct. You should have the vinegar at a constant measurement.
1	Additional information I would need to replicate this experiment would be the amount of vinegar needed to pour into the containers, the size of the containers themselves, and how long I would rinse the samples with distilled water after the samples are removed from the vineger.
-1	One way the coud of used rocks instead of weights to improve the experiment design. ^P Second way instead of measure the length after the weight they should measure the length of the plasic while the weight was ve there.
-1	I would need to know how much vinegar was poured into each container, I would need to know what temperature the samples were in and if that temperature remained constant for the 24 hours. I would also need to know how I would rinse each samples with distilled water without losing any sample, and I also need to know how many times I would need to rinse the sample in order to remove all of the vinegar.
1	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know what the 4 different materials are that I'd be testing. In addition, I would need to know the exact amount of vinegar that needs to be poured on each sample. Finally, I would need to know that I was finding the difference in the mass from start to finish for each of the samples. Otherwise, I would be missing my dependent variable!
-1	To exactls replicat this expirement you leashneed to know how much of each sample to test with. Also you would need to know how much vinegar to use in the different cups, lastly you would need to know how much distilled water to rinse the samples with.
-1	3. For the conclusion the students could of put what kind of plastic they used. Also they could made the data table a little more details. ^p The students could have improved their experiment by baming some of the plastics,also they could of put the size of the weights.
1	This polymer investigating lacks numerical data. I can lab make a solid conclusion. ^p The students can improve the late by saying the original length of the plastic and the ending length. They can also say how much weight they are using and what plastics they are using.
-1	Pandas and koalas are similar because they are specialists. They only eat one thing and one thing only. They are eating something that will grow back. Both the animals are different from pythons because a python eats living thing and making that specie go extinct.
-1	I would write what
-1	By the process or doing it, the graph showed me that the amount of stretched of T1 and T2 didn't change, both plastic had the same stretched. And it would change by adding more weights because the plastic wouldn't be resible as the other one.
1	The additional information I would need in order to replicate this experiment are the mass of the containers because if you placed the substance in with the sample, in order to find the mass of only the sample, you need to subtract the mass of the container. Also it is necessary to know how much vinegar to mix in with the sample. I also need to know what type of environment to put the samples when I am waiting 24 hours. Lastly, I need to know what type of container to put the samples in because it may have an affect on how the samples react.
-1	In conclusion plastic A is the strongest and plastic D is the weakest. ^p The student could improve the validity of the results by 1) saying in T1+T2 they used 2 different sets of 4 kinds of plastics. And 2) you can also have at least one other person there to varify this.
1	Based on the student's data t concude that plastic type A was the strongest plastic because it streched the least amount two ways that the students could have improved the experimental design are: adding a trial 3 and recording the original length of the plastic.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to Koalas in Australia, because their both specialist and they both stick to one main food. Pandas rely on bamboo and Koalas rely on eucalyptus leaves. They are diff from pythons because pythons are all over the world while pandas and koalas are in one place, also because a python is a snake and a generalists, while pandas and koalas are not.
-1	"Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists. A specialist is an animal that can't adapt well to new climates. ""A panda eats almost nothing but bamboo and Australia's koala bear, which eats eucalyptus leaves all year"".(2)These animals need a certain environment to get their certain food while a python is a generalist ""who with the assistance of technology can live anywhere"".(19)"
-1	A. Some plastics are more strichy or maybe some of them are harder than the other brands.^p B. They could of put the time period a little longer. Also for T2 they could of put more weight than T1.
-1	A) The students data shows that polymers B & D were the stretchiest while the plastic types A & C were not that flexible. B) The student could have improved his/her experimental design by using a control which he/she can compare the results to a plastic used. The student may also perform more trials in order to get an averge amount stretched (mm).
-1	In order to replicate experiment Acid Rain'' you will need  get four seperate but identical containers, the materials marble, limestone, wood, and plastic. After you have these materials you need to weigh them before you put each of them in their own container, After you have these materials you need to weigh them before you put each of them in their own container. After 24 hours, rinse the solutions off and weigh the mass again.
-1	A)My conclusion is that plastic B stretched more than the other types of plastic, because plastic A stretched up to the average 11 and plastic B had an average of 22.5.^p (B)Two ways the student could have improved the experimental are (1)The student could do more trials, and (2)the student could gave the information about the measure of each sample of plastic.
-1	After reading the groups procedure the additional information you need is the dependent and independent variable, central and costenit,hypothesis, and problem statement.
1	A conclusion I can draw, based on the start ends data, is that plastic type B had stretched the most at the end of both trials. Also, I can draw the conclusion that type A stretched the least after both trials. 2 ways the students could have improved the experiment or validity of the results are to control variables and perform more trials. They could have improved the experiment by controlling the number of weights, type of clamp, and the height that the plastic hung from.
-1	Pandas in china eat only bamboo,while koalas in Australia eat only eucalyptus leaves.Both animals have an exclusive food.Pythons as said in the article are generalists.Pandas and koalas are generalists.Pandas and koalas are generalists as well.
-1	To replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to put into the container.
-1	I would have to write down what causes acid rain and put chemicals make up acid rain and why isn't it poisoning to humans.
-1	To replicate this experiment you will need the same ingridients and procedures also the time. Also, do a graph showing the difference in weight. We need to add the same amount of vinegar in each one.
-1	One additional information you would need to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar, in ml, is needed to pour into the containers. Every container needs the same amount of vinegar. The other additional information needed is the fact that the difference in mass has to be determined or else, you would miss the point. The third additional information needed is what to measure the samples with and what unit they need to be measured in. They all need the same unit and balance.
-1	"To replicate this experiment I would need to know what type of measurement item I would need to ""determine the mass of each sample"". Also I need the names of the samples that I need to use, such as marble or wood. Lastly, I need from the procedure, a control because I need to be told what I am testing for."
-1	The china's panda which eats almos nothing but bamboo,or Australia's koalas bear which eats eucalyptus leaves exclosively.
-1	To replicate this experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar the group poured in each container without knowing the amount of vinegar I would get different results.
-1	Pandas and koalas are similar because they both only eat one type of food, pandas eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves. They are different from pythons because pythons eat more than one type of food.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because all they eat are plants. Also, they are both in the category of specialists. They are both different from pythons because pythons are in the category of generalists. Pythons don't eat plants like pandas and koalas.
1	In order to replicate the groups experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to add each sample. Also you need to know what kind of container plastic, metal,paper this matter depending on how much vinegar would keep out of. Also the mass of the sample all need to be the same different mater make different conclusions due to surface area and such.
-1	Pandas from China are similar to koalas in Australia because both can live off of one thing and only in that area. Bamboo for pandas and eucalyptus leaves for koala bears. Those animals differ from pythons because pythons can eat a variety of different animals and can live almost anywhere from Florida to Antarctica.
-1	The students need a list of material,also the students should write that we have to form a hypothesis.The students must also add that we have to form a conclusion at the end of the experiment.
1	a) Based on the student data, plastic B is the most stretchable. Plastic B stretched an average of 22.5mm, while the next most stretched plastic was D, with an average of 20mm. ^p b) To improve validity/design, the student could have conducted more trials. The students also should have specified exactly how heavy the weights used are, so that the experiment is recreatable.
-1	a) Based on the data given, I can see that plastic A is the strongest polymer and doesn't have much stretchability. ^P b) To validate her results, I think the student should have put how long the plastic was originally and how many millimeters long it was after the weights to see the actual data for ourselves. The student could tested the plastic a third time to improve her experiment.
-1	A. With the student's data you can tell that trials aren't that much different in the amount stretched. ^p B. Two ways the student could have improved the results was add less weight, another thing is let it hang longer.
1	The group will need to put to the following information. What are the four different samples. What type of containers will be needed. Also what size. They will also need to put in there lab is what is the temp of the vinegar. (The temperature should be consistant)
-1	You would need to know what kind of material was used, marble, limestone, wood and plastic. What would happen if the samples cud not dry within 30 minutes. If you could not let them sit longer or if it was crushal that they would only sit for 30 minutes. Lastly you would need to know how you determined the mass of the samples. What do you use to measure the samples and when?
-1	After you would rinse each sample, it would be best to check the temporter, how much vinegar where used and I would like to know specifcly how many acid you use in this experiment.
-1	The group would need to table the date, explain what they are trying to experiment and also write a good conclusion on what the  outcome of their experiment was. This will help the panature to make and sence as to what you are trying to find out and, day.
-1	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour in the four separate containers. You would also need to make sure you put the same amount of vinegar in each container. The last thing you would need to know is how much sample to put in the containers, and make sure its the same type of sample you used at any time.
-1	I think the next step is to see what mass is the highest the normal one and the lowest is. We want to add it up to see what mass is better, we need to see what sample looks good because you don't want to have a bad one.
1	First, the mRNA attaches to a ribosome and then the ribosome reads the mRNA in segments of three, called codons. For each codon, there is a complementary amino acid. Secondly, tRNA picks up the needed amino acids and brings them to the ribosome. Thirdy, the amino acids attach to each other and form a chain of amino acids according to the way in which the codons are read on the mRNA strand by the ribosome. The chain continues to form until the ribosome reaches the stop codon on the mRNA strand. Lastly, the ribosome disconnects from the mRNA strand and the protein is relased to perform its job in the cell.
-1	The additional information that would be needed is determining the mass of four different samples, which is the marble, limestone, wood and plastic. The information that is needed is the starting and ending mass.
1	To replicate this procedure I'll need to know the size of the containers. I'll need to know the samples and I'll also need to know the amount of vinegar to put in each container. The amount of vinegar and the size of the container could be important variables if they are not the same for each sample.
-1	"Pandas from China and koalas from Australia are similar because they aren't harmful and they only eat bamboo and eucalyptus leaves so they don't eat other animals such as the python eats animals as it said "" In 2005 in the Everglades a python swallowed an alligator and it exploded."" So that makes the python different from them."
-1	The pandas and koalas are alike because they both only eat one thing. As with the pythons they eat a few different things. They are different types of animals so they need different things.
-1	a. My conclusion would be that the plastic type B would be better because it stretched more. ^p b. One way the could have improved there experiment design would have been leaving on e of the plastic bags, with the weights the whole time ( control) types of plastic bags.
-1	"Koalas and pandas are simillar. This is because they both survive on one thing basically. The python however, is a very abandant species as the panda and koala are more rare. The python is also more dangerous because does ""best in and around humans."""
-1	Pandas and koala bears are similar because in the article it says they are specialist animals. Panda & koalas are also are vegetarians. They are both different from pythons because pythons are generalist animals that are carnivorous.
-1	Koala's and panda's are different because they only eat on type of plant, which makes them specialists. However, a python is a generalist that will eat many things which is why it such a problem in Florida.
1	a) A conclusion that can be made from this data is that plastic type B has the most stretchability. This is because in both trials it stretched 22-23 mm and that is more than any other plastic type tested. ^p b)Two ways that the student could have improved the experimental design was to make the weights used for every plastic sample constant. Also for the plastic samples the student could make sure to have the starting length afall the plastic types be the same and constant. Making as many aspects of the experiment constant maker fur more all work results
-1	The students have to measure the four different samples when they remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water. They have to measure before the ending mass because it may different than the ending mass.
-1	A conclusion I can draw for the stretchability for polymer plastics is that for plastic type B the stretchability must be real stretchy because for the T1 it was 22mm and for T2 it was 23mm. But for type C it stretchability went down, T1 14mm and T2 13mm. ^p The students could of improved the design by adding a T3. Also they could of used more than just four different types of plastics.
-1	My conclusion about the students data would be the farthest amount stretched he recorded one thing I would have done would be to change the plastic to which is more durable and Add T3 so their can be more results.
-1	The conclusion based on the students data shows that with the same weights but different types of plastic are different. The students could have added more trials and added more weight to there experiment.
-1	In my opinion, they should add more informations of, the temperature because different samples migh react differently in lower or higher temperature. They should do more than just one try with each sample, It should be at least 3 to get a better data, they should have measure mass much more often as well.
-1	To repeat the lab, the students are the information i would need is how much vinegar they used for each piece.
-1	Panda in China are similar to koalas in Australia because the pandas only eat one bamboo and the koalas eat eucalyptus leaves, but the pythons are very different because they eat anything, the pythons have eaten a wood rat and tried to eat an alligator but the python exploded. I know this because it was said in the article in paragraph 21 about the China pandas and the Australian kola bears and paragraph 11 and 14 about the pythons. This means that the pandas and kola bears are not harmful but the pythons is harmful.
1	You would need to know how much vinegar you pour in each container, so the results are accurate. You would need to know how big each sample was you would also need to know what temperature this experiment was done at.
-1	In order to replicate the experiment, I need to know how much vinegar did the group of students pour in the identical containers, I need to know how much vinegar the students pour because its really important because maybe the students pour less vinegar in one cup and pour more in the other.
1	"A) plastic type B was the most stretchable while plastic type A was the least. ^p B) They could add more trials and be more specific when the say ""weights"" by adding how heavy the weights are."
-1	In order to replicate this group's experiment I would need to know how much vinegar they put in each container. Also, I would need to know what type of marble, limestone, wood, and plastic was used. Finally I would also need to know which type of vinegar was used in their experiment.
-1	A) When testing our hypothesis whe had came to a conclusion. It seems to be that when we tested the plastic type by stretching it we had found out that when stretched a second time the numbers seemed to have went up and then on plastic type D it stood at 20. ^P B) The students could have improved their experimental design if they would have told us what types of plastic they had used. Also, they could have added how many times they did both trials.
1	If I wanted to replicate the experiment I would need to know what kind of containers to use, I would need to know if I should cover the samples in the containers I would also need to know what the samples are. How am I suppose to know what I am tasting if I don't know what the samples are.
-1	When simulating acid rain in this experiment it would be important to include consistant measurements to the data and results are accurate.They should start with the same ammount of mass ea each sample.  so  the change is seen easier and each sample is affected equally. By the same wage, It is also important that the samples be submerged in the same amount of vinegar. B/C the labs goal is to nonce change based on acid rain, its important the experiment be as close and as repeated as possible.
1	If you wish to replicate the experiment they would have to show or tell how much of the vinegar is needed, does the samples need to rest on a tray or on a paper towel, and tell the size of each of the samples.
-1	You would need: Starting mass, ending mass, and difference in mass in order to replicate the experiment.
-1	Based on the students data results, plastic type D stretched the most. Plastic type A stretched the least. Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and validity of the results are that they should of measured how long each piece of plastic was before they added the weights so they can know how much the plastic stretched. Also they should of used the same amount of weights.
-1	1. You need to know the amount of vinegar being added. ^p 2. You need a controle group. ^p 3. You need to know what your labeling each container.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Aus because they are both anunaunt  and specialists that eat bamboo &,eucalyptus leaves so they can't be harmful to humans. They live in a certain place, unlike pythons which are generalists so they can rang from Florida to Antartica to outer space.
-1	Pandas are similar to Koalas because they are both specialists. They only live in one part of the world and eats only one type of food. They are different from pythons because, as the article says, Pythons can survive in many habitats, unlike Pythons, Pandas and koalas can only live in one place.
1	In order to replicate the experiment the information that i would need is how much vinegar do i pour on each sample. Also i would need to know what type of vinegar to use and do i put the samples in a refreglatar or reave them at room temperature.
-1	You would need the names of the samples you were using.
-1	"(A) I can conclude from the students data table that plastic type ""B"" had the most stretchibility. The weakest type of polymer was type ""A"". ^P (B) Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design was leave the weights on for longer than five minutes, or done more trials."
-1	"Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia, because they are animals that only eat bamboo and eucalyptus. They don't eat meat. As stated in the article, ""China's pand which eats almost nothing but bamboo or Australia's koala bear which eats eucalyptus leaves."" These animals are harmless to our envinroment. They both differ from a python because the python eats animals. In the article it states, ""A python swallowed an alligator."" Pandas and koalas don't do this."
-1	You would need the size of the container, amount of vinegar used, the types of samples. Such as earth, wood, limestone, and plastic and how much of each to put in.
-1	"China's panda and Australia's koala bear are both specialists. while pandas eat nothing but bamboos, ""and koala eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively,""  phython's a generalist. According to the oraicle  we live in an age that favors generalist rather than specialists; and other generalists are best in and around humans."
1	Based on the student's data, the order of stretchability for the plastic types from greatest to least is B, D, C, A. Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design/validity of the results would've been to use the same clamp for all the experiments and to use the same amount of weights.
-1	Pandas in China and Koalas in Australia are similar because they both only feed on one thing. Pandas eat bamboo and Koalas eucalyptus leaves. Unlike pythons which eat just about everything including Aligators.
-1	The group should include more information about what problem they are investigating, there is nothing whatsoever about the statement of what they are trying to figure out another thing needed to replicate the experiment would be the amount of marble, limestone, wood and plastic. The students need to say exactly how much of each of these substances they used. They would also need to specify the amount of vinegar that was poured into the containers so that there is and an exact, identical amount.
-1	"Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar in many ways like it states in the passage ""China's panda which eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's koala bear, which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively"" meaning that the two animals can live off eating one thing. They are different from pythons because unlike pythons, pandas and koala bears are not household pets."
1	In conclusion, the polymer with the most stretchability is Polymer B in T1 and T2 polymer B had the highest number of mm out of the other polymers. There for it stretched the greatest amount. In the future I think it would be helpful for the students to record how much weight they used to test each polymer. I also think it would be beneficia to test more trials to be confident in the results.
-1	A Form the data table, it can conclude that plastic A was the most durable when stretched, and the least durable was plastic B. Plastic A stretched 10mm than 12mm while plastic B stretched 22mm than 23mm. ^P B 1. There is no indication that after the first trial, he replaced the plastic, which of made the results from trial B invalid. 2. He could have done the lab again or added a trial 3 and 4. The more you do the later the better off your results will be. It would make it more valid. 3. He could have also tried the plastics because if me great longer from another it would stretching.
-1	Plastic type be was the most stretchable. Stretching on average of 22.5mm and plastic type A was the least stretchable, stretching an average of 11mm. The students could have improved the experimental design by specifying how much weight they attatched to each plastic and then keeping it constant. The way the procedure is written now we don't know if the amount of weight was used constant.
1	a)From viewing data from me polymer investigation, it shows that plastic type B truly has the most stretchability, because it stretched the most out of all the polymers at average of 22.5 mm.^p (b)The experimental design would have better if adopt a trial 3, then the accuracy would go up. Another thing that you could have done was specified how much weight your adding, and if its the same amount for all plastics.
-1	"The 3 key materials that I need to replicate this experiment is ""vinegar"", a few plastic containers and a ""triple beam balance""."
-1	For step two how much vinegar do you pour in? ^p For step four how do you remove the samples from the containers? ^p For step three what do you label the container?
-1	Pandas are similar to Koalas because they are both specialists. They only live in one part of the world and eats only one type of food. They are different from pythons because, as the article says, Pythons can survive in many habitats, unlike Pythons, Pandas and koalas can only live in one place.
-1	Well think that you would need all of the same steps in the procedure to repeate it. But don't have to find the mass between each object.
-1	Pandas and koalas are similar because they both eat plants for most of their life. They are also similar because they are both specialist that live in warm areas. The two are different from pythons because a python is a generalist, which depends on other animals to survive such as a raccon.
-1	How much of the material did they put into each container. Was there a controlled part of this experiment. Did they conduct a graph for this experiment.
1	1) tRNA reads the strand of mRNA using anticodons.2) tRNA retrieves amino acids.3) The process continues until a stop codon is reached.4) The newly formed polypeptide is released.
-1	A) The students wanted to see which plastic was mor strechibal. B) Two ways the students could have improved the experiment is by doing a 3rd trial say how far off the table.
-1	The conclusion I get on this students data is that all the plastics have been weighed and been measured. But as they did the 2trial the data changed and for plastic type D its weight and length was the same it means that it was hanged up last and they took it down too fast so it measures the same.
-1	The information you would need in order to replicate the experiment the mass of four labels marble, limestone, wood, and plastic is to show how you got the mass of each. what material did you use to get this answer. What effects did it have on all material such as color and size.
-1	A) We can conclude that plastic type B is stronger because on the best trial I only stretched by mm. Then on the second trial it decreased to stretch by 1 more. Picture type A is strong but on the first trial it stretches 10mm, while on the second trial it stretched & mm more. We would rather have the stretch decrease than increase. B) The students could have added more time to the bags being stretched and they could have done more trials.
-1	Pandas and koalas are similar because they are both specialist and eat plants that grow in one area. Pythons can live in more places than pandas or koalas because they can eat mainly panda and are going to new places to live like U.S.
-1	China's panda
1	The student can conclude that type B was the most stretchable while type A was the least. The student should have given an exact length for each plastic to be stretched. The student should also have the exact amount of weighs that was to be applied.
1	First you need to know how much vinegar they used in each samples cup. Secondly the amount of each substance should be the same. Next, what kind of container are they placing this substances up out with a lid or lid toowide?
-1	The second trail the first two numbers are higher then the two in the first trail. One number lower than the first time and the number the same, one way the could improve there experiment is they could of made a graph with there results.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists species. As said in the article, they are exclusive in what they eat. They are both different from pythons because a python can eat many different things, which the pandas almost only eat bamboo and the koalas eat almost only eucalyptus leaves.
-1	Pandas and koalas are similar because they eat mainly one type of food for them. Pandas eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves. They differ from a python because pythons can eat just about anything...one even attempted an alligator.
1	To replicate this experiment some more information that could be used would be to say in the procedure what amount of vinegar to use for all 4 cups.This would make a huge impact on the experiment outcome .Also include the size of the containers to use and the unit to measure the mass of the samples. Say what sample to use in the experiment too.
-1	When the group said to place a sample of one material into the o ther container then repeat. It does not make sense because people could repeat putting the sample into all the containers back to back. You don't have to wait 24 hours for letting the sample sit in the container.
-1	The additional information that is needed to replicate this experiment would be how long the test samples would stay inside of the containers. You would also need to know what substance is also mixed in with the vinegar. You will also need to have 4 containers and they have to be labeled by which substance is inside of the container.
-1	A China's  panda eats nothing but bamboo, and a koala bear mostly eats eucalyptus leaves. When someone thinks of the contents and countries they think of that animal. Those animals are supposed to be in the places and the same goes to pythons. They are not supposed to be there so they shouldn't be introduced.
-1	Pandas In China and koalas in Australia are similar because they are both specialist species, animals needing stability and little change in their lives. Pandas eat mostly bamboo, and koalas eat mostly eucalyptus leaves. They are both different from pythons because they are a generalist species. Pythons are able to adapt to changes in enviroment, location, and food supply unlike pandas & koalas.
-1	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because the article says they both eat an exclusive food so they can't be imported. Pythons, however can eat different things and can survive in a generally warm climate.
1	In order to replicate the experiment, the procedure would have to add more details. In the first bullet, the four samples should be stated as marble, limestone, wood and plastic. You should describe the containers where to put the samples and how much you need. There should be a step where you find the starting mass before the experiment. Also there should be measurements of how much vinegar should be added. One last thing, is when you say to determine the mass on the procedure it should say,in grams.
-1	In this procedure would need to be given the names of the samples and also in the procedure they missed some vital steps like gathering the materials and also cleaning up in the end
-1	First off, we need to know how we should be measuring the mass, like with what kind of scale. They should also specify what units we are using such as grams. They also don't tell us how much vinegar to pour into these containers.
-1	"Pandas in China are different from Australia's koala bear because of what they eat. As the article says "" China's panda, which eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's koala bear which eats eucalyptus leaves.."" They are both harmful though , pythons are different because they eat other animals."
1	I would need to know how much vinegar  they used. How big the materials were that they used what kind of containers they were using.
1	To replicate this experiment, I would need to know what four different samples I am getting, and how to measure the mass. What containers do I put them in? How much vinegar do I put into the containers? Do just let the containers sit out in room temp for 24 hours? Do I cover the containers? How do you measure the ending mass of each sample?
-1	The additional information that they would need in order to replicate the experiment is a sample of one material into one container and label. Repeat with with remaining samples placing a single sample into a container. After 24 hours remove the samples and allow samples to sit and dry. The additional information that would be needed is the starting mass the ending and the difference.
-1	To replicate the experiment, you would need to find out how much vinegar to pour into the containers. We know that marble lost 4 grams, limestone lost 1.3 grams, plastic lost 1 grams and wood stayed the same, but we need to know how much vinegar was used for each sample.
-1	"Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia and they both differ from pythons. Pythons, like humans are generalists. ""We live in an age that favors generalists rather than specialists"" because generalist are more effective to adapting. However, pandas and koalas are specialists, ""which eats almost nothing but bamboo"" or ""eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively."" Therefore, unlike pythons, they cannot adjust."
-1	The pandas in China are similar to koala bear in Australia because they only eat plants. There different because the one in China eat only bamboo and the one from Australia eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively.
-1	Chinas panda bear are similar to Australia's koala bears because Chinas panda eats ''Almost nothing but bamboo...'' and Australias koala ''eats eucalyptus leaves...''Both species are different from pythons because pythons will eat almost any animal anything meat.
1	a. That substance B streached the fastest and then D, then C and finally A would streatch the least amount. ^p b. The student could have given the orginal length of the plastics. The student could have specified how much the clamp and the weigths weigthed.
-1	needed to replicate this experiment
1	a) My conclusion is that plastic B was the most stretchable plastic. It stretched out between 22-23 mm in the two trials. ^p b) The student could have stated how many weights he/she added. He/she also could have recorded the original lengths of each of the plastics he/she was measuring.
1	After reading the procedure in order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know how much of each sample  there  was. Also, you would need to know what kind of vinegar they're  using, as well as how much to pour into the container. You  might also need to know how long to rinse each sample and if it was with warm or cold water.
1	The procedure is missing some critical info. First of all the group does not say what the samples are so to remake the lab. I would not know what I needed to get even though it shows it in the table they should have it in the procedure. Also the group does not give details on how much vinegar to put in the containers. Finally the group did not say the size of the container.
1	Plastic type A- 10(mm)T1-T2 12 ^p B-22(mm)T1-T223 C-14(mm)T1-T2 13 ^p D-20(mm) T1-T220 ^p 2 ways the student could have improved. ^p 1. Repeat the whole procedure 3 times. ^p 2. Measure 3 times the sample of one type of plastic and measure length.
-1	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia both live in places they can survive. Both only eat certain foods found in places they live. Pythons however, will eat anything. This means they can go to different parts of the world if the habitat is suitable.
1	Any additional information needed in order to replicate the experiment is what are the four samples that's mass are being determined, where are the containers with the samples going to be kept for the 24 hours and how long the samples need to be rinsed with distilled water.
1	1)You will need to know the temperature of which to keep the samples at. ^p 2)The surface are in each of the samples exposed to the vinegar. ^p 3)How much vinegar to put the samples in.
1	The procedure given doesn't have enough information so that someone could replicate it. What else is needed is to state the different samples needed. It also needs to identify how much vinegar goes into each container for the samples. Lastly, we need to know what kind of containers (how big) each of them are.
-1	Pandas in China mostly eat bamboo and koala in Australia only eat eucalyptus leaves. Thats how they are the same. The are different from pythons because they eat more than one kind of food source.
-1	More information is needed, more steps because its not enough to direw a conclusion. Not many materials are listed.
1	To replicate the acid rain experiment you would need to know what size container to use,you would also need to know what the four different samples were. Lastly, you would need to know how long to note samples for.
1	mRNA leaves the nucleasmRNA codes for tRNAamino acids on tRNA bond to form a chain of amino acidsthe chain of amino acids folds into a protein.mRNA leaves the nucleas after being copied from DNA.  This mRNA is single stranded and contains codons for specific types of proteins.mRNA then travels to a ribosome.  At the ribosome, the mRNA is run through, and tRNA with anticodons on one end attach to the mRNA.Each tRNA particle has an amino acid attached on the opposite end of the anticodon.  When two tRNA particles connect to the mRNA at the same time, a peptide bond forms between the two amino acids and the first piece of tRNA can disconnect.  As this process continues, the amino acids begin to form a chain.Once the strand of mRNA contains a stop codon and tRNA reaches it, the final amino acid will bond to the chain.  Once this animo acid disconnects with the tRNA, the strand folds up into a specific protein.
1	NSR
1	A) Based on the data I have seen, plastic B seemed to be stretched out the most, meaning it's too durable. And plastic A seemed to be stretched out the least, meaning it's more durable. ^p B) One way to improve this experiment is by telling us the amount of weight the student added to the clamp. Also, to get better results the student should've conducted a third trial.
1	In order to replicate this experiment ,I would need to know how much vinegar to place in each container.Also I would need to know of each sample was, are solid piece or,n  small or pieces. The greas would need to identify
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both are mammals. Pandas and koalas are just like humans, warm blood. But they are different from each other pandas eat bamboo and koala bear eat eucalyptus.
-1	To replicate the experiment you would me to have the procedures, the materials and the time to do this project.
1	The student can conclude that polymer plastic B is the most strechability because it has the longest length in both trials.Two ways this experiment could  have been better is by saying how much weight to add to each plastic polymer and second by repeting the experiment more than twice.
-1	Samples of what, and what is the purpose of the experiment, why should we do it, what do we have to do with the data.
-1	a Based off the information given plastic type B stretched the most, the type D, type C, type A. ^p B. Place more weight & let it hang longer or less.
-1	some additional information that would be need with this experiment is a hypothesis. This is because you should predict and guess the things you could be working with. You would also need a scale to tell you how much each sample range in grams.
-1	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they both adapt to their enviornment. Pandas eat bamboo and koalas eats eucalyptus leaves which in their locations is very popular. Koalas and pandas are differant from pythons because they are mamals and have differant care.
-1	The additional information I would need to replicate the experiment is the materials, all the steps that they did.
-1	Panda in China only eat bamboo the Koala in Australia eat eucalyptus leaves exclusively.
-1	In order to replicate the experiment, i would need to know the quanity of the variables (sample materials). It is neccessary to know how the samples were rinsed w/ distilled water use. Were they put in a diff container or just held under a steam of water, mostly evapoltantiy I need to know how they determined the mass of the samples, what was their tool of measurement.
-1	The students can conclude plastic type A is least stretchable, and plastic type B is the most stretchable and will be less likely to break. The students could have improved the experimental design by telling us what they originially measured the plastic in (ft,cm,in. e.t.c) Told us how many weights and how much they weighed and the type of tape that tapped the plastic in the table.
-1	I a conclusion based on the students data, is that plastic D streched the same amount at 20mm for trial 1 & trial 2. But plastic B streched the most. For trials 1&2 at 22mm for trial 1, and 23mm for trial 2.
1	In order to replicate the experiment, the group's procedure should mention which samples to use. (marble, limestone, wood and plastic). It should also contain more detailed information such as the amount vinegar poured in each container, and the size of the samples needed for testing.
1	The plasma membrane is selectivly permeable.  It lets oblects in or out of the cell.  Diffusion lets objects move through the plasma membrane along the concentration gradient, without the need for energy.  Facilitated diffusion lets objects too big to fit through the plasma membrane enter the cell through transport proteins without the need for energy.  Active transport lets objects enter the cell against the concentration gradient through protiens.
-1	Well, you will need the same amount of objects to the other experiment, so it could be the same.
-1	In order for me to replicate this experiment I would need to come up with an hypothesis, the reason why I am doing this experiment and a conclusion.
-1	One piece of information that would be needed to replicate this experiment is the amount of vinegar in the container. What the four samples are.
-1	Pandas in  China are similar to koalas i Australia because they both prosper off mainly one food source and live in one part of the world unless they are taken away or raised somewhere else. A python differs from these animals because it can be found living in many places and eating many things.
-1	a) Repeating the experiment T2's measurement increased successful than T1, by not changing the variable and repeating the experiment eight time. Shows how the wight of the weights affe3cted throughly. ^p b)The students could improve the experiment design by increasing the weight OR the weights, and using different types which usually be the dependent variable.
-1	After ending this groups procedure,i have decided that the group needs to show how much vinegar is added to each container.They should also include a purpose and problem statement to clear up wh we are going to replicate their procedure.
-1	Chinese pandas and Australian koalas almost exclusively eat bamboo and eucalyptus leaves respectively, while pythons are only restricted to warm weather places, with no food restrictions. As stated in paragraph 20, pythons are generalists. As stated in p. 21, koalas and pandas are specialists.
-1	First of all you'll need to measure the container bxitsals and subtract it from weight of the samples so you don't accidently have extra weight. Calculate the time diffrence it took to prepare them. Use the same weight of each sample.
-1	To replicate the experiment, you would need to know the amount of vinegar to pour into each sample. In order to get accurate results you would
-1	"Chinas panda's and Austraillia's koala's are alike because there both specialist's. As stated by abel Achen biach, ""A specialist is chinas panda, which eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's koala bear, which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. But as for the generalists they can arguably live anywhere."
-1	a.Based on the data I concluded that plastic B was the best plastic in trial 1 it measured 22 mm and trial it measured 23mm meaning it was the sturdiest plastic. ^p b. The student could have measured the plastic before doing the experiment, making it a free trial, and the students could have added the weights and see how much weight it could hold before it fell to the floor instead of waiting for 5 minutes.
-1	The students didnot start with saying what materials ar needed. They also didnt say what the four samples were. The students did specify on what kind of materials they were useing!
1	In conclusion type A is the strongest plastic and type B is the weakest plastic. ^P In this experiment they should have more trials than just 2. ^P They also should have put how much weight they used and if it was the same amount of weights.
-1	"Pandas from China eat nothing but bamboo, Australia's koala bear eats eucalyptus leaves. These are both some type of plant. Where as for the pythons They eat meat for example in Everglades 2005: ""A python swallowed an alligator bit then it exploded."
-1	"Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they don't eat meat, like for example in paragraph 21 it states that, ""China's panda, wich eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's koala bear wich eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively"". Their are different from pythons becaus pythons eat meat."
-1	Plastic type A had the most impact on stretching, type B and C only stretch out one mm longer & type a was the same.^p The student could have added more plastic types and let the weights clamps hang for a longer time.
-1	Pandas in chem are similar to koalas in Australia because they both eat plants and not other animals. they are both different from phytons because phytons eat other animals.
1	In order to replicate this experiment, we should be told the amount of vinegar in m/ls and tell what the container is made of and define if there needs to be a constant temperature in the 24 hours of it trying in an incubator.
-1	The additional information that is needed it the amount of vinegar being poured into each cut. Also you need to record all the information. They need to know how much water they are putting into the containers after 24 hours.
1	a) The students conclusion is that although plastic D was the most accurate, plastic B stretched the most for both trials. ^p b) The procedure does not say the amount / what unit of weight was added. The plastics also must all be the same length.
-1	a)I see that the amount stretched of plastic A & B increased on the second trial, but the amount stretched of plastic A decreased and the amount stretched for plastic D remained the same. ^p b) The student could have make a third trial to see what the outcome would be. The student could have made the trials for another period of time so instead of five mns and he does ten minutes for each of them.
-1	To replicate the experiment you may want to know what the mass is when you take the sample out of the containers incase the water has an effect on it. Also you can try doing the experiement for a shorter or longer amount of time to get better results. Last you can let the samples dry longer to see what happens to them.
-1	In order to replicate this experiment, we would need to know the temperature of the vinegar as well as how much vinegar to put in. Both of these could vary and therefore change the result of the experiment.
1	a) Plastic type B stretched the most during both trials of this experiment. ^p b) First, the student should have used the same length of each plastic. Finally, the student should make sure each type of plastic is hanging the same length off the table.
-1	After reading the group's procedure, additional information I would need to replicate the experiment to the different types of samples I would use, what to label the samples and what should I measure in.
-1	"Pandas in China are similiar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialist who are not favored at this age. The python is different than these animals because it is a generalist. In the article it says, ""mammals are warm & fuzzy...but animals such as lizards & snakes tend to be less respected or supperied""."
-1	a. Plastic B, C are almost similar but plastic D stretched the most. ^p b. Two ways they can improve experiment was by adding a 3rd trial and also adding different times.
-1	I will need to collect all of my materials. i will need four containers and my four samples. i will have to place the four samples in the containers. Then put
-1	Pandas and koalas are both two specialists species. The panda constantly eats bamboo mainly found in China and koala's foods mainly consist of eucalyptus leaves. Therefore these two animals can only survive in these regions that fufill they're eating habbits. These two animals are different from pythons because based on the article pythons are capable of adjusting to their environments like they did after Huricane Andrew destroyed their homes.
1	Additional information needed to replicate this experiment would include: ^p - What kind of four samples are being used. ^p - How much vinegar to pour into the containers. ^p - What kind of containers are being used. ^p - How to to remove the samples and place them into containers. ^p - What to label each of the separate containers.
-1	"Pandas in China are similar to koalas because they are both specialist species. There not harmful to humans , "" eats almost nothing but bamboo """"= . They different from a python because their generalist and "" we're degrading the earth at an alarming rate"". Pythons are dangeros to hummans."
-1	China's panda is like Australia's koala bear, because they both eat mostly one thing, bamboo and eucalyptus leaves. Also both of these things are vegetarine leafs and trees. Unlike a python which pretty much eats anything it can fit into its mouth even a alligator.
-1	"The group's procedure is not very well done. In order to replicate their experiment the procedure would need more controlled variables. It says ""pour vinegar"" , there is no precise measurement this could lead to varied results. The procedure also lacks multiple trials. The experiment was only completed once. In order to be replicated multiple trials as well as controlled variables are needed."
-1	The conclusion based on the student's data is that with trial1 and with trial 2 there were some changes happen the amount of plastic stretched more the second trial than the first. Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design is in what minute did the stretch begin and what plastic was the strongest.
1	To replicate the experiment, the procedure would require more detail. One piece of information that is omitted is the amount of vinegar used in the experiment. It is also important to know what temperature the experiment was kept at during the 24 hours. Finally, the procedure needs to include details about the experiment, for example if the whole sample must be submerged.
-1	The conclusion
1	Plastic type B is the stretchiest plastic and plastic type A is the least stretchiest plastic. The students could have improved there design by naming the type of brand of type they used and the amount of it to hold the plastic wrap. Another improvement would be measuring the amount of plastic so that it would be the same amount for each plastic type and using the same weights for each trial so that the results would be correct.
-1	pandas and koalas are similer in that they are both specialists and require very specific food sources like bamboo and eucalysts leaves (achenbach 2). They are both diffrent from pythons in that pythons have a universal and adaptable diet, unlike the panda and koala whos diet limit its movement, it can adopt and live manny places. It is a generalist.
-1	1. Gather materials. ^p 2. Put on apron & goggles. ^p 3. Set up materials. ^p 4. Por vinegar into a identical containers. ^p 5. Put marble, limestone, wood, plastic into their separate containers. ^p 6. Put name on container, wait 24 hours. ^p 7. Rinse the samples with distilled water. ^p 8. Put samples out to dry. ^p 9. Determine the mass & other differences. ^p 10. Clean up materials.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both eat a plant (bamboo, leaves) they are both small mamals and they both are rare. The koala bear & panda bears are different from pythons because the python has a long under body and eats other animals. The python doesnt have arms or legs, and the python cant climb a tree as well as the panda +koala bear.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both have one major source of food to rely on. They are both different from a python because a python is a carnivore while pandas and koalas are herbivores.
-1	based on the students data I can conclude that the second time the trial was done the amount that the plastic types stretched was greater than that of trial one except for type C which it shrink 1mm from 14 to 13 in trial 2. Two ways they could have made this experiment better is if they were specific on how much weight was used, and if in the chart they included the amount of time that each plastic type hong.
-1	Know all the materials they used and what the wight of each of the materials were before they were placed in the water.
-1	The information I would need to replicate the experiment is; the four different samples, the four identical containers, the amount of time to let the samples sit, and the product to rinse the samples with so I could let them sit for more.
-1	Extend the time of the weight longer, like about 10 minutes more. Use different materials.
-1	"Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they both are specialists. Pandas eat nothing but bamboo and they really couldn't live anywhere else, same with koalas; it eats only eucalyptus leaves. Specialists like the panda and koala cant servive everywhere. However pythons are generalists, ""with the assistance of technology they can live anywhere around the world"" - they are very differant from specialists."
1	1.the RNA goes into a ribosome2. transfer RNA brings amino acids to mach the sequence of the mRNA.3. as more tRNA comes  with more amino acids the amino acids start to stack up4.the compleated protins breaks away.
-1	a) Based on the students data and the 2 trials. The experiment seems to be very valid and accurate. ^p b) One way to improve this experiment I believe would be a third trial run, only because plastic type A was 2mm away from the first trial which doesn't give you a great conclusion. And another way I would change this would be explain better. Its very confusing and not specific, how much were the weights etc.
1	I can conclude that the plastic A stratched the least from all the plastics used. And plastic B stratched the most from all the plastics used. Plastic A stratched less because it was better than plastic B. The student should have done more than 2 trials. And also should have told us the measurement of of the plastic bag. So we could know how much it was before it stratched.
-1	Pandas in China are similar to kolas in Australia because their diet consists of one thing, which on the other hand there different from pythons because pythons have a larger variety of food they can eat. That makes it easier for pythons to live in so many different locations than a koala or a panda.
1	Based on the students data, it can be seen that plastic B stretched 22mm (T1) and 23mm (T2) making it the most stretchable. ^p The students could have improved the experiment by including the length of the plastics before stretching them. Also, they need to include how much weight to add to the plastic, making it the same for each plastic to be valid.
-1	a) According to the conclusion, plastic type A length stretch more than the rest of the plastics. Plastic A is the most stretchy. ^p b) The student could had added more trials and a can and groups.
-1	A) The student tested the plastic 4 different types they altumetly had the same close 1 to 2 mm streach rate.^p B) The student could have stated how much each whight should whigh he could have also changed the results then messure or record the difference.
1	A) Based on the students data I can draw the conclusion that plastic type B had the most stretchability. If you you reter back to the graph in trial 1, plastic B was 22 and in trial 2 it was 23 which was more than any of the other plastics. B) One way in which the students could have improved the experimental design is by adding another trial. They could also have told you how long the type of plastic was to regin with in the first place therefore increasing the validity and accuracey of the experment.
-1	One way the student could improve the experiment better is by putting the plastic in both directions at the same time. Another way he could improve is he could add heavier weights to get better data. ^p In conclusion when he added the weights to one end that made the plastic stretch and, increasing its size.
-1	To replicate the experiment, you would have to know how much vinegar to use in each container, you'd need to know what time you started so that you could remove the samples from the containers as soon as exactly 24hrs have passed and lastly you'd need to know what time you set the samples out to dry so they can dry for the full 30min.
-1	"The pandas of China and the koalas of Australia are similar because they are both categorized as a ""specialist"" species-in this case both types of animals eats only one type of food,which means they can only live in places where that food is available. On the other end of the spectrum if the pythons which is a ""generalist"" species - they can eat many different things and survive in different places, which means that pythons are more capable of spreading than pandas and koalas are."
-1	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they both eat about nothing. They are both different from pythons because a python eats a lot of things.
-1	I can conclude that on average plastic B was the most stretchy plastic. Validity could have been improved if the student states how heavy the weights are in step 4. Also the student could have stated an exact point on the table so that all plastics were in the same conditions to make the experiment more valid.
